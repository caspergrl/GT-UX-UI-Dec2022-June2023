## Please take the End-of-Course Instructor Survey (please complete before the last day of class if you have not done so already).

Trilogy, as a company, values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It is hard for us to know what these areas are unless we're asking questions.

Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are key members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we'd appreciate your sharing feedback at the following link:

## Overview

In this class, students will continue to work on their Final Group Project 3 and presentation for the UX/UI Boot Camp. The final project is an HTML/CSS website prototype powered by design thinking that creatively solves human-centered needs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Write a case study outline for their Final Group Project 3 presentations.

2. Build an FE dev case study in Google Slides.

3. Prepare for their group presentations.

4. Practice their presentation slides and UI prototype demo.

5. Establish the order of their presentations.

## Class at a Glance

- Introduce students to the goals and requirements for presenting their Final Group Project 3.

- Give students the entire class day to continue working on their projects and begin initial work outlining their presentations.

- Each group should submit a one-page presentation plan by the end of the day.

## Prepare for Class

- Today's class is all about introducing students to their final project presentation and giving them plenty of time to iterate their prototypes for their final goal.

- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/24.1-Final Project Day 7 slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Eogzwb7NmhtuG-BHGP4IJWY3fr1s1ffEKnaGCywwm4s).

- Make a PDF copy of the Google slides to share with students and teaching assistants (TAs) via Slack. Feel free to modify the slides slightly to fit your style, but be sure to cover the same concepts and activities.

- As the instructor and TAs, keep in mind that the success of your students after boot camp is largely dictated by the quality of the projects in their portfolios. Encourage your students to do their best work and steer them toward producing high-quality final projects!

- The schedule for the Final Group Project 3 follows:

  - Day 7 (today, final week):

    - Students work on their projects.
    - Students begin planning their final presentations.

  - Day 8 (Presentations 1):

    - Students present their final projects!

  - Day 9 (Presentations 2 and Graduation):

    - Students present their final projects and graduate!

- Today, at your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.

  - In these workshops, student groups will rotate among the instructor and TAs for help on specific topics, such as iterating ideas, paper prototype testing, etc.
  - These workshops should be 10 to 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

> **Instructor Note:** This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom to a small space to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [22-24-Final-Project/03-TimeTrackers/24.1-Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KE9IYNEjsMwLeboQsRcrM1luYmWaZY6giMGuNzpdwGk/edit?usp=sharing).

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Office Hours: (45 mins before class) (Office Hours)

Encourage students to come early and utilize the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

## 8. Instructor Do: Presentation Strategies (10 min)

📌 The goal is share some ways to improve students presentations.

**Presentation Best Practices.**

- Review 5 tips.

1. Eye contact

   - Harder to do online but look at where your camera is.

2. Use sketches & wireframes to focus on functionality not aesthetics.

3. Use mockups and prototype animations to guide the imagination.

   - Recommend capturing a gif or putting a video in the presentation.

4. Leave time for a Q&A after the presentation.

   - Bring back your prototype during your QA and navigate to areas of where questions arise.

5. Over deliver.

   - Consider your audience and make the presentation stand out.

- "“70% of employed Americans say that presentation skills are critical for career success.”

  - Presentations are about being prepared. This applies to your technology as well.

  - We want to be efficient when presenting, so make sure to inform students their presentations must be completed before the next class.

> **Instructor Note:** Tell students, **"Presentations can get out of hand! By following simple rules, you can make them really good."**

**Presentation Strategies.**

Most important, tell a story as a group: Stories are much more interesting than facts because stories entertain us. Storytelling grabs and maintains attention.

- **Consider your audience, and use a pitch mindset:** We don't know you and we are seeing this presentation for the first time. Consider what we are curious about.

- **Ask questions at crucial moments:** A question breaks up your regular presentation rhythm and helps mark what you’re saying as important.

- **Avoid reading directly off the slides:** Reading from a slide that everyone in the room can see (and read for themselves) is boring and makes you look unprepared.

- **Highlight important points with visual metaphors:** Visual images of a situation we’re already familiar with help retain points longer in our memory.

- **Organize your presentation by main points or takeaways:** Tell me, show me, then conclude.

- **Share the responsibility:** You are a team, and everyone needs to show their contributions. Use an MC and make sure to introduce yourself.

- Tell students **"Presentations do not have to be formulaic, but they should be planned and practiced!"**

- Use a clear and simple presentation template and image background.

**Tell a story of you design process as a group.**

- We want to hear how you got from point A to point B.

- Act as if we have never seen your process.

- Practice matters!

> **Instructor Note:** Pause and check-in with your students to make sure every one is on the same page.

## 9. Student Do: Working Session 2—Prototyping and Presentation Planning (50 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Put groups into Zoom breakout room. Recommend every group share their presentation slides with the instructional staff now.

![Get to Work](images/practice-bruce-lee.jpg)

- Get to work!

  - Remind students that you and the TAs will be coming around to help teams progress.

## 10. Student Do: Group Project Presentation Outline One-Pager Activity (15 min)

- Make sure student groups prepare a one-page project presentation proposal.

- The project presentation proposal should include:
  - Project title
  - Team members
  - Presentation outline
  - Rough breakdown of group roles and responsibilities

- Have students post their project presentation outline one-pagers on Slack.
- Review and approve presentation proposals.
