# 24.3 Lesson Plan: Final Group Project 3, Presentations 2 and Graduation

## Please take the End-of-Course Instructor Survey (please complete before the last day of class if you have not done so already).

Trilogy, as a company, values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It is hard for us to know what these areas are unless we're asking questions.

Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are key members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we'd appreciate your sharing feedback at the following link:

## Overview

In this class, students will present for the final time in the UX/UI Boot Camp. Then they will answer open-floor questions from you, TAs, and classmates. Finally, they will graduate from the UX/UI Boot Camp.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Select from remaining teams to make their Final Group Project 3 presentations.

2. Provide a useful critique of the students' projects.

3. Complete and Graduate from the UX/UI Boot Camp.

## Preparing for Class

- Students should expect an extended class todayâ€”these presentations tend to last longer than our allotted time.

- Students should know the parts of their HTML/CSS that impress you and the TAs, as well as what they can improve on for future projects. This will help direct their focus for future projects in their UX/UI/FE careers (what aspects of web development they need to work on).

- We recommend inviting any industry professionals, friends, and/or colleagues to be guests for the presentations.

  - Share your excitement and your students' work with your Student Support Manager (SSM). Coordinate with your SSM for extra chairs, parking instructions, etc. for your guests.

- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/24.3-Final Project Day 9 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x7yP6jN-fLYe4zOt3Izyzh8iAGHvPHCq6wsvWVA8Hns).

- Make a PDF copy of the Google slides to share with students and teaching assistants (TAs) via Slack.

- Schedule presentations to end 20 to 30 minutes before the end of class to leave time for congratulations, celebration, and graduation from the UX/UI Boot Camp.

  - Work with your SSM for the last-day celebrations.

- *Arrive early to class* so that you can set the room up for presentations, with Panopto, microphone, and the rest of your recording equipment.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [22-24-Final-Project/03-TimeTrackers/24.3 Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xXJiN4l7EJDnMNJ89KhL6IYUJm0NhYYYpFHJdUx4EAk/edit?usp=sharing).

## 1. Instructor Do: Set Up Your Equipment (15 min)

- Set up your laptop and make sure to clone all students' projects onto your local machine to avoid switching computers throughout the night.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation**:** Create unique zoom recordings for each presentation.

## 2. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (1 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation**:** For the final class do one last engagement strategy. A group screenshot or a collective high five to keep the energy and enthusiasm high.

- Launch today's slides: [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/24.3-Final Project Day 9 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x7yP6jN-fLYe4zOt3Izyzh8iAGHvPHCq6wsvWVA8Hns).

- Say your hellos and check if students have any questions for the final day of the UX/UI Boot Camp.

## 3. Instructor Do: Introduce Presentations (5 min)

- Congratulate your class on developing their projects to a state worth presenting. Assure them that they should take pride in what they've done!

- Tell students to deploy their latest changes to GitHub. After this, all it will take is a quick pull to get any changes.

  - Make sure groups have deployed their websites to GitHub Pages. We want to see their projects in action!

- Give students a rundown of how their presentations should pan out.

  1. The presentations should last about 10 minutes, followed by two to four minutes of open-floor Q&A.
  2. Presenters should speak **into** the microphoneâ€”this ensures we capture high-quality audio for their recorded presentation.
  3. They need to show confidence! All of them have contributed to impressive projectsâ€”they need to recognize that and project that during their demonstrations.
  4. Introduce any quests to the presentation if applicable.

- Ask which groups would like to go first, then second, then third, and so on. When groups stop responding, assign the remaining teams to random slots (and write this list down).

## 4. Student Do: Presentations Part 1 (90 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Have groups choose a primary person to run the presentation and use Google Slides present mode. Recommend they load their prototype in a tab in their broswer.

- Go down the list and send each group up to the front of the class. Give students roughly two minutes of setup time.

- When a group nears the nine-minute mark, motion for them to draw their presentation to a close (like pointing to your watch/imaginary watch). **Don't say anything**â€”you don't want your voice to interrupt their talk, especially since you're recording them.

- Follow each of these presentations up with questions about their projects. Let TAs and classmates ask questions, too.

- When the Q&A session ends, stop recording. When Panopto stops, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.

---

## 5. Break (15 min)

Say, **"Let's take a break before we get into the next set of presentations."**

---

## 6. Student Do: Presentations Part 2 (60 min)

- As for Presentations Part 1, go down the list and send each group up to the front of the class. Give students roughly two minutes of setup time.

- When the last group finishes, give them an estimate for when their recorded presentations will be available. Tell each of them that they should put their demonstrations up on LinkedIn, along with links to their GitHub deployments.

- Congratulate them! It's challenging to conceive, develop, and present a new web app. Remind them of all they've accomplished over the UX/UI Boot Camp, and tell them to imagine what they'll come up with in their UX/UI/FE careers.

## 7. Instructor Do: Close Class (5 min)

- Say, **"Awesome job on your presentations! Don't forget to capture your feedback and make any updates to your prototypes. Iteration is constant!"**

- Have students exchange notes.

## 8. Instructor and SSM Do: UX/UI Boot Camp Graduation (15 min)

ðŸ“Œ The goal is to celebrate the achievements of your students. What they have been through is awesome.

- Congratulate students on completing the rigorous Boot Camp.

  - Have everyone give each other a big round of applause.

  - Encourage a group photo, rounds of high fives, and other celebratory activities.

  - Students have worked incredibly hard over the past 24 weeks. The instructional staff should convey their gratitude.

- If available from the SSM, Present the UX/UI Boot Camp Certificates.

## 9. Instructor Do: After Project Demos (5 min)

After students have presented their projects, please take some time to submit their work to the form below.
