# 24.2 Lesson Plan: Final Group Project 3, Day 8/Presentations 1

## Please take the End-of-Course Instructor Survey (please complete before the last day of class if you have not done so already).

Trilogy, as a company, values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It is hard for us to know what these areas are unless we're asking questions.

Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are key members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we'd appreciate your sharing feedback at the following link:

## Overview

We have allotted two days for presentations. If your cohort is smaller and all of the final presentations can be accomplished in one day, use this class period as another working session.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Practice presenting information to an audience.
2. Provide constructive feedback to their peers.

## Class at a Glance

- Students will present their Final Group Project 3.

- We recommend inviting any industry professionals, friends, and/or colleagues to be guests for the presentations.

  - Share your excitement and your students' work with your Student Support Manager (SSM). Coordinate with your SSM for extra chairs, parking instructions, etc. for your guests.

## Preparing for Class

- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/22.4-Final Projects Day 8 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yFvjo3eT2l7EFICHmWUdT7Zo7RGQ9HlBRggd6Ei7cv0).

- Make a PDF copy of the Google slides to share with students and teaching assistants (TAs) via Slack.

- In today's class, the first group of teams will make their Final Group Project 3 presentations.

- *Arrive early to class* so that you can set the room up for presentations, with Panopto, microphone, and the rest of your recording equipment.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [22-24-Final-Project/03-TimeTrackers/24.2 Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XrNZdJmUhAirElieNwVQ20Fc6v_6xqxKvP1ImgJGVgg/edit?usp=sharing).

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## 1. Instructor Do: Set Up Your Equipment (15 min)

- Set up your laptop and make sure to clone all students' projects onto your local machine, so as to avoid switching computers throughout the class.

> **Instructor Note:** Have all groups share their Google slides presentations in Slack.

> :globe_with_meridians: Individual Zoom recordings can be made for each group presentation. Stop recording at the end of each short critique and re start during the short break between switching presenting groups.

## 2. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (1 min)

- Launch today's slides: [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/22.4-Final Projects Day 8 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yFvjo3eT2l7EFICHmWUdT7Zo7RGQ9HlBRggd6Ei7cv0).

- Review the final homework assignment: [22-24-Final-Project/04-Homework/24.1-01-Unit-24-Homework-Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJszqIOn5yTjWwWiOdpXQ86-NLYdmMCRNriEw9GA8yc/edit#heading=h.s08zrdwak03s).

## 3. Instructor Do: Introduce Presentations (5 min)

- Congratulate your class on developing their projects to a state worth presenting. Assure them that they should take pride in what they've done in a short amount of time!

- Tell students to deploy their latest changes to GitHub. After this, all it will take is a quick pull to get any changes.

  - Make sure groups have deployed their solutions to GitHub Pages. We want to see their projects in action!

- Give students a rundown of how their presentations should pan out.

  1. The presentations should last about 10 minutes, followed by two to four minutes of open-floor Q&A.
  2. Presented should speak **into** the microphone—this ensures we capture high-quality audio for their recorded presentation.
  3. They need to show confidence! All of them have contributed to impressive projects—they need to recognize that and project that during their demonstrations.
  4. Introduce any quests that have joined the presentations if applicable.

- Ask which groups would like to go first, then second, then third, and so on. When groups stop responding, assign the remaining teams to random slots (and write this list down).

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: All students should be present with videos on. Start each presentations with coming off mute and clapping for 5 sec. and clap when they end their presentations as well. Start the new zoom recording and give the group a start signal.

## 4. Student Do: Presentations Part 1 (80 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Have student use the present mode in Google Slides.

- Go down the list and send each group up to the front of the class. Give students roughly two minutes of setup time.

- When a group nears the nine-minute mark, motion for them to draw their presentation to a close (like pointing to your watch/imaginary watch). **Don't say anything**—you don't want your voice to interrupt their talk, especially since you're recording them.

- Follow each of these presentations up with questions about their projects. Let TAs and classmates ask questions, too.

- When the Q&A session ends, stop recording. When Panopto/Zoom stops, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.

---

## 5. Break (15 min)

Say, **"Let's take a break before we get into the next set of presentations."**

---

## 6. Student Do: Presentations Part 2 (90 min)

- As for Presentations Part 1, go down the list and send each group up to the front of the class. Give students roughly two minutes of setup time.

- When the last group finishes, give them an estimate for when their recorded presentations will be available. Tell each of them that they should put their demonstrations up on LinkedIn, along with links to their GitHub deployments.

- Congratulate them! It's challenging to conceive, develop, and present a web solution. Remind them what they accomplished over the UX/UI Boot Camp, and tell them to imagine what they'll come up with in their UX/UI/FE careers.

## 7. Instructor Do: End Class (1 min)

- Say: **"Awesome job on your presentations! Don't forget to capture your feedback and make any updates to your prototypes. Iteration is constant!"**

- Have students exchange notes.

## 8. Instructor Do: After Project Demos (5 min)

After students have presented their projects, please take some time to submit their work to the form below.
