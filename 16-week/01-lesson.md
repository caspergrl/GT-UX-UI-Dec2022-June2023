# 16.1 Lesson Plan: UX/UI Portfolio, Day 1

## Overview

This is portfolio week. Students will prepare content for their online and offline UX portfolios and familiarize themselves with the UX interview process.

### This Week

This week is dedicated to career development and becoming employer-ready. By now, students have completed two projects for homework and two group projects in class. They'll start refining that work for their portfolios and the hiring process.

The class will focus on portfolios and interview-readiness, but do tell students that this work also prepares them for the coming weeks. Additionally, students will practice interview skills to prepare for the job market.

### The Next Nine Weeks

In the coming weeks, students will build their online portfolios as they learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

- Week 16: UX Portfolio Wireframes and Case Study Development

- Week 17: HTML/CSS

- Week 18: Advanced CSS

- Week 19: JavaScript

- Week 20: Bootstrap

- Week 21: Web Analytics

- Weeks 22-24: Final Group Project

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Gather design inspiration for UX portfolios and case studies.
2. Execute a portfolio case study outline.
3. Produce case study assets.

## Class at a Glance

This is not a lecture-heavy class. Students will spend most of today's class working on their portfolios.

Your goal is to communicate the importance of a design portfolio to the UX/UI profession and to job hunting. Students likely know that portfolios are essential to being employer-ready. Still, they'll need encouragement to take up the challenge now. For example, they might need guidance on what to share and which aspects to focus on.

*Note:* All activities started in class will extend into students' homework.

## Preparing for Class
- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [16-Week/01-Slides/16.1: Portfolio Week, Day 1 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zk13VsP8ZzmrK818rzTC59dRNL7eqLWnu13B4anad1M/edit?usp=sharing).

- Make a copy of the Google slides to share with students and teaching assistants (TAs). Feel free to add minor updates to fit your own style, but you're required to cover the same UX concepts and activities.

- Share your copy of the slides with the TAs who will save it as a PDF and add it to the class's GitLab repository.

- Think about how you can help students get into the right mindset for portfolio creation as well as how to introduce the concept of case studies for the storytelling of their work.

- We've suggested real-world ideas to cite in your lecture, but do take time to come up with a few professional anecdotes to support today's lecture.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Encourage students to come early and use the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

## Time Tracker

- Have your TAs reference the [16-Week/03-Time Trackers/16.1 Time Tracker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ybzoi7iC7ynNej9c_ADQqlrr0WdGm0H9pN3apCLClDg) to help keep track of time during class.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

  - Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.

- Share today's objectives.

  - Remind students that they'll need to have their work from throughout the UX/UI Boot Camp to create their portfolios.

## 2. Instructor Do: Portfolio Week and the Next Six Weeks (5 min)

- Welcome students to Portfolio Week.

  - Say, **"For the rest of the course, we'll prepare our portfolios for the job hunt."**

- We're almost two-thirds of the way through the course.

This week we will start on UX Portfolios and Case Studies. In weeks 17-21 we will be working on online portfolios. Weeks 22-24 will be our final project.

## SLIDE 7
Review

## SLIDE 8
UX/UI employers have stated that a candidate MUST HAVE a portfolio to be considered for a job. A portfolio is a critical part of the hiring process because it explains who the designer is in the industry and it helps companies understand his or her design process. Today we’ll look at the components of an employer-ready portfolio so that you can be ready for your job search.

- It will be next to impossible to get a UX/UI job without a polished portfolio.

**UX/UI Portfolio Requirements**

There are two types of portfolios: offline and online. Today we'll begin working on our offline portfolios and continue working on them for most of this week. These are important when students go for in-person interviews. In the following weeks, we'll work on online UX portfolios.

- Online portfolios are the first thing a recruiter or hiring manager will see during the hiring process.

- Offline portfolios are a more comprehensive collection of artifacts that students will bring with them for on-site interviews for a portfolio critique.

## SLIDE 11
**What are hiring managers looking for?**

The Nielsen Norman Group surveyed 204 professionals in charge of hiring and asked what they look for in a portfolio. Also, Career Services surveyed 30 UX/UI professionals who hire from our student pool. They want to see:

- Logical thought processes
- Hard and soft skills (e.g., ability to communicate, work with a team, work independently, make decisions based on results and user feedback, learn from mistakes, and solve problems)

## SLIDE 12
- Design process
- How you come to conclusions about what you see in data or hear from users
- Importance of being data driven
- Knowledge of methods to use and when to apply them
- Openness to feedback
- Desire to improve

**How do you show all of you skills?**
A portfolio is made up of two parts: (1) the portfolio homepage and (2) three to five case studies of your best work.

**Portfolio homepage should include basic information, such as:**  

- Name, job title, and photo
- Three to five big, nice images of your best projects
- Short bio highlighting the most important points
- Social links
- UX designer resume (downloadable PDF)
- Contact details or a contact form so people can easily reach you

**The case study should include:**  

- A header image with a great title
- The biggest challenge you've faced as a designer
- You and your team's roles
- Your design process — present the design process step by step, including the methods used, the decisions taken, and why you did it that way.
- The results
- The learnings


## SLIDE 14
**What projects should students include in a portfolio?**

Showcase your best three to five projects. Make sure to include projects that fit your future employers' needs or your personal preferences. Employers usually look for proof that candidates have already performed similar work to what the role will require.

## SLIDE 15
**Remember who your user is**  
When looking for a UX job, your readers represent your target audience, and your portfolio represents your product. In this case, your user could potentially hire you.

Therefore, provide the user a good experience, the information he or she needs, and make everything easy to understand.

UX leads, hiring managers, and recruiters won’t spend much time reading a candidate's portfolio. If they don’t find what they're searching for, or find the content chaotic and hard to understand, they’ll just move on to the next candidate.

## SLIDE 16

## SLIDE 18
Review

## SLIDE 19
Review my quote

## SLIDE 20
Brooke and Jason are former students who both got UX jobs within a few of months out of class. What do their portfolios have in common?
- Clean
- Simple
- Minimal colors and content (letting the work be the focus)
- Easy to navigate
- Access to Resume from the nav
- Access to work from the homepage directly
- Simple personal branding

## SLIDE 21
Review

## SLIDE 22
1. Tip 1: The homepage should make a good first impression.

## SLIDE 23
2. Tip 2: Show the design process and decisions in the portfolio.

## SLIDE 24
3. Tip 3: UX portfolios follow a standard format.

   - Ask, "**Who is the user of your portfolio?**"

   - Answer: NOT YOU! The “users” of your portfolio will be hiring managers, recruiters, or fellow UX professionals, so your portfolio must appeal to these different groups of people. You can use this format to your advantage when structuring your portfolio.

## SLIDE 25
4. Tip 4: Market yourself correctly.

   - Whenever a recruiter lands on your website, they'll ask themselves, "Is this person a UX designer?"

## SLIDE 26
5. Tip 5: Tell a story.

   - Give your portfolio a narrative by explaining who you are, where you have come from, and where you want to go.

## SLIDE 27
6. Tip 6: _Review the recruiter tips._

## SLIDE 31
## 10. Student Do: Case Study Inspiration Activity (10 min)

- Say, "**Let's gather some case study inspiration!**"

**TAs,** Slack out to students the activity instructions: [16-Week/01-Activities/16.1/16.1-03-Case-Study-Inspiration](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Wk7sjTbiKwDIcQ7yp-RqjLvF4OL9qjCJNLJT45bRPns).

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is for students to gather inspiration for their UX/UI case studies into a mood board.

**Instructions**

Students will continue using the mood board started in the design portfolio inspiration activity.

**Deliverable**
Students will add selected case studies to their mood boards.

## SLIDE 32
Review

## SLIDE 33
Case studies should be displayed in a way that is scannable and easy to follow. Include relevant photos and screenshots that tell the story, such as early sketches, whiteboards, research documentation, or final images. In addition to visuals for each project, create a case study that includes the following:

1. The problem(s) you had to solve or the hypothesis you came up with for solving it
2. Your specific role in the project and how you collaborated with others
3. How you came to your proposed solution(s)
4. How your proposed solution(s) solved the problem
5. Challenges you faced, including design concepts that were ultimately not pursued
6. How the project affected the users and the business
7. What you learned
8. Next steps

## SLIDE 34
**Goal: Tell a Story**

- Who is the client, target organization, or industry?
- Was this a team effort or a solo project? If you were working with a team, what was your role? What were the other roles involved?
- Who is the end-user? What user personas are you designing for?

## SLIDE 35
**Review the quote from Sarah Bellrichard, Senior Vice President of Wholesale Internet Solutions and UX at Wells Fargo.**


## SLIDE 36
**Divide Your Case Study Into Two Parts**
- Create an executive summary of the project and then follow that with a detailed explanation of your design process.

## SLIDE 37
**Review the quote from Laura Klein, author of *Build Better Products* and *UX for Lean Startups*.**

- Laura Klein is a thought leader in the world of UX design.

- **TAs, Slack out:** [UX for Lean Startups](https://www.amazon.com/UX-Lean-Startups-Experience-Research/dp/1492049581/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=lean+ux&qid=1583189368&sr=8-4)

## SLIDE 38
**Review the summary example.**
Set up your stories by writing a two- to three-sentence summary of the product and how it works.

- Define the problem/objective.
- Define the solution.
- Define how the student contributed to the project.

## SLIDE 39
Review slide (Make an Employers job easy)

## SLIDE 40
**Explain the process in the case study.**

Always start with some user research that frames the problem. For example, perhaps write the following:

- “We analyzed the to-do lists of 140 users ages 18-40 for a period of three weeks and discovered that about 60% of their tasks were location-dependent. From this analysis, we made four user personas and defined their experiences in managing to-do lists with customer journey maps.”

## SLIDE 41
**Show the deliverables with purpose.**

- The student's design process should drive the deliverables he or she shares.

## SLIDE 42
**Use captions for artifacts.**

- Label screens—don’t assume the audience members know what they're looking at.

## SLIDE 43
**Share the media documenting the process.**

- Show the sketches and iterations, not just the polished final solution.

## SLIDE 44
**Show off the final solution.**

- Don’t hide the clickable prototypes. It pays to let the audience use the solution.

## SLIDE 45
**End with a conclusion.**

End with a conclusion sharing what you learned. This last part shows the final answer to the original question. It’s not enough here simply to show the final deliverable. In this section, demonstrate impact—how might the proposed solution improve the situation?

## 13. Student Do: Case Study Activity (30 min)

**TAs,** Slack out to students the following file:
[16-Week/02-Activities/16.1/16.1-04-UX-Case-Study-Outline-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ieF7CNcgpezhwri3TKP7sDn8sYExYv4SK-Hg_Va_F7o)

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor students during this activity to be sure they're making progress and review their outlines.

**Summary**

Here, students will practice planning their portfolio case studies and iterating on their existing projects.

**Instructions**

- Set a 40-minute timer.

**Deliverable**

Students will create an outline in Google Docs or another format. Ask students to share their outlines with you and the TAs for feedback and any annotations.

## 14. Instructor Do: Case Study Review (15 min)

Call the class back to attention for a short review.

Instructions:

1. Ask, **"Who wants to present their work?"**
2. Invite that student to present his or her work to class.
3. Have the class walk through the student's work.
4. Critique the student's work.
5. Thank the student for sharing.
6. If there is time, ask another student to share his or her work.

- Review any overarching questions and offer closing thoughts.

## 15. Instructor Do: Recap and Introduce Portfolio Homework (5 min)

- **Say,** "You're getting closer to completing the UX/UI Boot Camp and finishing your portfolios to share with potential employers. It seems like an overwhelming task, right? I can imagine you saying, "There's so much to do! How do I know what to build? Where do I start?"

- **Say,** "The homework this week will serve you in good stead for the rest of the boot camp and beyond. The reality is that your portfolio is never really done."

**This Week's Deliverable**

- This week we’ll continue iterating on the work started in class. Students will work to design a responsive homepage mockup for their portfolios along with two case studies to get them ready for their portfolios.

- **Why a portfolio?** So they can get a job in UX, UI, product design, or web design.

- TAs, share homework: [16-Week/04-Homework/01-Instructions/16 Unit Homework Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zCu1EOVi0bMrHJ-LGOmXSpeYdWc-3WNosb9mKTIBlgk).

- Say, **"We did a lot today. Keep making progress. Keep working on your tasks at home and bring your improvements in the next class."**

Remind students that you're available for office hours after class.

Wish everyone a good night.
