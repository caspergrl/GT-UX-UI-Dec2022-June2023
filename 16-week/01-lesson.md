# 16.1 Lesson Plan: UX/UI Portfolio, Day 1

## Overview

This is portfolio week. Students will prepare content for their online and offline UX portfolios and familiarize themselves with the UX interview process.

### This Week

This week is dedicated to career development and becoming employer-ready. By now, students have completed two projects for homework and two group projects in class. They'll start refining that work for their portfolios and the hiring process.

The class will focus on portfolios and interview-readiness, but do tell students that this work also prepares them for the coming weeks. Additionally, students will practice interview skills to prepare for the job market.

### The Next Nine Weeks

In the coming weeks, students will build their online portfolios as they learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

- Week 16: UX Portfolio Wireframes and Case Study Development

- Week 17: HTML/CSS

- Week 18: Advanced CSS

- Week 19: JavaScript

- Week 20: Bootstrap

- Week 21: Web Analytics

- Weeks 22-24: Final Group Project

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Gather design inspiration for UX portfolios and case studies.
2. Execute a portfolio case study outline.
3. Produce case study assets.

## Class at a Glance

This is not a lecture-heavy class. Students will spend most of today's class working on their portfolios.

Your goal is to communicate the importance of a design portfolio to the UX/UI profession and to job hunting. Students likely know that portfolios are essential to being employer-ready. Still, they'll need encouragement to take up the challenge now. For example, they might need guidance on what to share and which aspects to focus on.

*Note:* All activities started in class will extend into students' homework.

## Preparing for Class
- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [16-Week/01-Slides/16.1: Portfolio Week, Day 1 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zk13VsP8ZzmrK818rzTC59dRNL7eqLWnu13B4anad1M/edit?usp=sharing).

- Make a copy of the Google slides to share with students and teaching assistants (TAs). Feel free to add minor updates to fit your own style, but you're required to cover the same UX concepts and activities.

- Share your copy of the slides with the TAs who will save it as a PDF and add it to the class's GitLab repository.

- Think about how you can help students get into the right mindset for portfolio creation as well as how to introduce the concept of case studies for the storytelling of their work.

- We've suggested real-world ideas to cite in your lecture, but do take time to come up with a few professional anecdotes to support today's lecture.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Encourage students to come early and use the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

## Time Tracker

- Have your TAs reference the [16-Week/03-Time Trackers/16.1 Time Tracker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ybzoi7iC7ynNej9c_ADQqlrr0WdGm0H9pN3apCLClDg) to help keep track of time during class.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Present the Slideshow (2 min)

- Open the [16-Week/01-Slides/16.1: Portfolio Week, Day 1 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zk13VsP8ZzmrK818rzTC59dRNL7eqLWnu13B4anad1M/edit?usp=sharing) slide show provided as an initial guide for today's class.

  - Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.

- Share today's objectives.

  - Remind students that they'll need to have their work from throughout the UX/UI Boot Camp to create their portfolios.

## 2. Instructor Do: Portfolio Week and the Next Six Weeks (5 min)

- Welcome students to Portfolio Week.

  - Say, **"For the rest of the course, we'll prepare our portfolios for the job hunt."**

- We're almost two-thirds of the way through the course.

- For the next six weeks, students will work on their UX/UI online portfolios and case studies.

## 3. Instructor Do: UX Design Portfolios (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to discuss the importance of a design portfolio to the UX/UI profession and to job hunting. This supports the first learning objective of the day, which is to have students gather design inspiration for their portfolios.

UX/UI employers have stated that a candidate MUST HAVE a portfolio to be considered for a job. A portfolio is a critical part of the hiring process because it explains who the designer is in the industry and it helps companies understand his or her design process. Today we’ll look at the components of an employer-ready portfolio so that students can be ready for their job search.

- Ask, **"Who wants to get a new job?"**
- Call on a student to share what job he or she hopes to get after completing this boot camp.

- Do not sugarcoat the challenge of finding UX work! Nothing comes easy. It is a competitive marketplace, and students will need some grit and gumption to get into their first role.

- It will be next to impossible to get a UX/UI job without a polished portfolio.

**Design portfolios are required for job hunting.**

- The UX/UI portfolio is about showcasing their design process. Students want to find work that allows them to think and not just make things pretty.
- There's a big difference between showing a slick-looking final product and showing one's thought process in a portfolio.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share your professional insight on two ideas:
>
> - A designer must have empathy for the portfolio audience.
> - Hiring managers want evidence that a prospective designer can ideate, create, and problem solve.

**Review some common student questions.**

- *What do I need in my UX portfolio?*
- *What can I show if I have little experience in the design field?*

**UX/UI Portfolio Requirements**

There are two types of portfolios: offline and online. Today we'll begin working on our offline portfolios and continue working on them for most of this week. These are important when students go for in-person interviews. In the following weeks, we'll work on online UX portfolios.

- Online portfolios are the first thing a recruiter or hiring manager will see during the hiring process.

- Offline portfolios are a more comprehensive collection of artifacts that students will bring with them for on-site interviews for a portfolio critique.

**What are hiring managers looking for?**

The Nielsen Norman Group surveyed 204 professionals in charge of hiring and asked what they look for in a portfolio. Also, Career Services surveyed 30 UX/UI professionals who hire from our student pool. They want to see:

- Logical thought processes
- Hard and soft skills (e.g., ability to communicate, work with a team, work independently, make decisions based on results and user feedback, learn from mistakes, and solve problems)
- Design process
- How students come to conclusions
- Importance of being data driven
- Knowledge of methods to use and when to apply them
- Openness to feedback
- Desire to improve

**How do students show all of their skills?**

Students will need an online portfolio, but they don’t have to code it themselves. UX leaders do not care how it gets built.

A portfolio is made up of two parts: (1) the portfolio homepage and (2) three to five case studies of the student's best work.

The student's portfolio homepage should include basic information, such as:

- Name, job title, and photo
- Three to five big, nice images of the student's best projects
- Short bio highlighting the most important points
- Social links
- UX designer resume (downloadable PDF)
- Contact details or a contact form so people can easily reach the student

The case study should include:

- A header image with a great title
- The biggest challenge the student faced as a designer
- The team and the student's role
- The student's design process—present the design process step by step, including the methods used, the decisions taken, and why the student did it that way.
- The results
- The student's learnings

**What projects should students include in a portfolio?**

Students should showcase their best three to five projects. They should make sure to include projects that fit their future employers' needs or the students' personal preferences. Employers usually look for proof that candidates have already performed similar work to what the role will require.

**Focus on the big picture.**

When looking for a UX job, your readers represent your target audience, and your portfolio represents your product. In this case, your user could potentially hire you.

Therefore, provide the user a good experience, the information he or she needs, and make everything easy to understand.

UX leads, hiring managers, and recruiters won’t spend much time reading a candidate's portfolio. If they don’t find what they're searching for, or find the content chaotic and hard to understand, they’ll just move on to the next candidate.

**How do real-world designers gather inspiration for their portfolios?**

Inspiration-gathering is a skill that students will often use as professional designers. Take a moment to prepare students for the portfolio inspiration activity by connecting it to how real-world designers gather inspiration.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Where do you go for inspiration? Briefly share your professional process for getting inspired when it comes to gathering inspiration. What tricks, tools, and resources do you use?

 **Say,** "There are a ton of online resources for you to scroll through, but you might wonder if professional designers ever get inspired *offline*?"

Designers look at the world around them> They notice **juxtapositions**, such as the irony of watching a movie about deep-sea diving while taking an airline flight.

Designers notice **architecture**: They look up when walking under a bridge and check out how it's put together.

They go into nature: They notice the **light and dark** of shade versus sunshine, the **symmetries** of leaves or dragonflies, and the **asymmetries** of starfish or certain butterflies.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to share an example of where to go for design inspiration.

**UX/UI portfolio requirements:**

Walk through the slides on portfolio requirements.

- Share a video discussion with Nate Coleman from Google Maps for students to watch at home:

  - [https://codingBootCamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=951e7ed0-42a8-49e2-ad79-a8f80006cc12](https://codingBootCamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=951e7ed0-42a8-49e2-ad79-a8f80006cc12)

Now, help students get inspired by sharing the following online resources. They should refer to these during their activity—that's next!

- Portfolio resources to share in Slack:

## 4. Student Do: Portfolio Inspiration Activity (15 min)

- **Say, "Now that we have talked about what should go into a portfolio, let's gather some design inspiration!"**

**TAs,** Slack out to students the activity instructions: [16-Week/01-Activities/16.1/16.1-01-Portfolio-Inspiration](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10lqiuQXoP4lDibKLz3HSfdZpm4G_ZUvq-kG_kpI6fKo).

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is for students to gather inspiration for their UX portfolios into a mood board.

**Instructions**

First, students will create a mood board and look for inspiration on the web.

**Deliverable**
Students will produce a mood board made in InVision, Miro, or Pinterest.

**Note**
Students will share their mood board with classmates during the peer review scheduled after students complete the case study inspiration exercise later in class.

## 5. Instructor Do: Portfolio Dos and Don'ts (15 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to critique two design portfolios and explain to students what makes an effective portfolio homepage. This supports today's second learning objective, which is to have students execute a portfolio case study outline.

Now that students know why portfolios are important, you'll help them examine two portfolios carefully. The idea is to see what *works* and what *doesn't*. Afterward, students will do an activity planning their About Me page.

**Portfolio Example: David**
We'll review two case study examples from each of the designer portfolios.

- You can review the slide or open up the portfolio example here: [https://uxfol.io/djlim92](https://uxfol.io/djlim92)

Ask, **"What can students learn from David’s portfolio?"**

On the front page:

1. David’s portfolio is a good example of an elegant, minimalist portfolio. A designer doesn't have to clutter his or her front page with unnecessary information.

2. A designer needs a carefully selected font, a nice color scheme, and a simple introduction.

3. As for projects, designers can opt for the same mockups for each to create visual consistency, even if they choose different colors for the thumbnails.

**Portfolio Example: Valerie**
Later in the lecture, we'll review two case studies from each of the designer portfolios.

- You can review the slide or open up the portfolio example here: [https://uxfol.io/valee](https://uxfol.io/valee)

Ask, **"What can you learn from Valerie’s portfolio?"**

On the front page:

1. One glance at Valerie’s portfolio and it's apparent she spent significant time designing the page. The thumbnails are not only cohesive, but the whole portfolio has a color scheme that makes it look professional.

2. She does a good job providing basic but necessary information on her background.

3. Keep in mind that designers don’t have to stick to the color scheme of their showcased projects if they don’t fit together. Sometimes it’s OK to branch out a little bit and implement different colors that bring the whole portfolio together. It is a much better option than forcing clashing colors and elements together.

**Portfolio tips:**

1. Tip 1: The homepage should make a good first impression.

2. Tip 2: Show the design process and decisions in the portfolio.

3. Tip 3: UX portfolios follow a standard format.

   - Ask, "**Who is the user of your portfolio?**"

   - Answer: NOT YOU! The “users” of your portfolio will be hiring managers, recruiters, or fellow UX professionals, so your portfolio must appeal to these different groups of people. You can use this format to your advantage when structuring your portfolio.

4. Tip 4: Market yourself correctly.

   - Whenever a recruiter lands on your website, they'll ask themselves, "Is this person a UX designer?"

5. Tip 5: Tell a story.

   - Give your portfolio a narrative by explaining who you are, where you have come from, and where you want to go.

6. Tip 6: Review the recruiter tips.


**TAs,** Slack out the student example: [https://www.jasonhyun.com/](https://www.jasonhyun.com/)

**About Me Page**
To prepare students for the next activity, talk about the power of the About Me page.

Digital marketing entrepreneur Neil Patel says, "Your About Me page is one of the most important webpages on your site. If you get it right, it will brand you and position you as the go-to problem solver in your industry."

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** How did you learn to write an effective About Me page yourself? It took work, right? Let students know that even successful UX/UI designers are careful to get their About Me pages right.
>
> - Ask a TA to talk briefly about how he or she approached the About Me page.

An About Me page is never "finished." Professional designers iterate their About Me pages.

As students enter the design industry and gain experience, their About Me pages will grow. Before long, they'll have dozens of case studies to choose from and short and long versions of their bio, just like the top designers in the field!

In the next activity, students will create their own About Me pages.

## 6. Student Do: About Me Activity (15 min)

**TAs,** Slack out to students the following activity template with instructions: [16-Week/01-Activities/16.1/16.1-02-UX Portfolio Template About Me](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FxT_xHHZe2I2XOtfqIVrDdMbAXbweQbu8CIBxlBvHio).

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is for students to write content about themselves.

**Instructions**

Students will make a copy of the About Me page template and complete it according to instructions.

**Deliverable**
Students will complete an About Me page template with content.

**Note**
Students will use this content when they create the UX portfolio wireframes in the next class.

## 7. Instructor Do: About Me Review (10 min)

Call the class to attention for a short review.

Instructions:

1. **Ask, "Who wants to present their work?"**
2. Invite that student to present his or her work to the class.
3. Have the class walk through the student's work.
4. Critique the student's work.
5. Thank the student for sharing.
6. If there is time, ask another student to share his or her work.

---

## 8. Break (15 min)

It's time for a break.

Breaks are part of the learning process and help us get the most out of every lesson. Encourage students to grab a snack, drink water, and to stretch their bodies—they should step outside, if possible.

When students return, you'll talk about case studies and how they make portfolios stand out.

---

## 9. Instructor Do: Case Study Examples (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to critique two design case studies and explain to students what makes an effective case study. This supports the final learning objective of the day, which is to have students produce assets for case studies.

In this brief lecture, you'll use the real-life case study examples to help students appreciate the power of case studies for communicating their process to hiring managers. Then, students will do a case study inspiration-gathering activity.

We'll review two case study examples from the portfolios we reviewed earlier.

**Case Study Example: David**

- You can review the slide or open up the case study example here: [https://uxfol.io/project/047d9cd3/](https://uxfol.io/project/047d9cd3/)

- TAs, Slack out: [https://uxfol.io/project/047d9cd3/](https://uxfol.io/project/047d9cd3/)

Ask, "**What can you learn from the case study?**"

- Feel free to critique something on David's case study or use the provided anecdote.

On the case study page:

- Scroll down to the "Challenges and Limitations" section.

- He included a "Takeaways" section in his case studies, detailing what restraints the project had. If a designer worked on a project for a client, chances are he or she also had some limitations, which resulted in a design that might not be the ideal solution. If a designer include this in his or her case study, it gives a great base for understanding the complications of the project and also the final work itself.

**Case Study Example: Valerie**

- You can review the slide or open up the portfolio example here: [https://uxfol.io/project/043e9353/Smart-Platform](https://uxfol.io/project/043e9353/Smart-Platform)

- TAs, Slack out: [https://uxfol.io/project/043e9353/Smart-Platform](https://uxfol.io/project/043e9353/Smart-Platform)

Ask, "**What can you learn from Valerie's case study?**"

On the case study page:

- Scroll down to "The Process" section.
- In her Flying Chalks project, Valerie summarizes her case study by covering the steps she took to reach the final outcome. No matter how short or long a case study is, open with a summary to aid comprehension. A good summary can consist of the steps of the design process if appropriate. It can also be an overview of the case study itself and could serve as the navigation inside the case study.

Having learned by reviewing others' work, it's time for students to gather inspiration for their own case studies—that's next!

## 10. Student Do: Case Study Inspiration Activity (10 min)

- Say, "**Let's gather some case study inspiration!**"

**TAs,** Slack out to students the activity instructions: [16-Week/01-Activities/16.1/16.1-03-Case-Study-Inspiration](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Wk7sjTbiKwDIcQ7yp-RqjLvF4OL9qjCJNLJT45bRPns).

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is for students to gather inspiration for their UX/UI case studies into a mood board.

**Instructions**

Students will continue using the mood board started in the design portfolio inspiration activity.

**Deliverable**
Students will add selected case studies to their mood boards.

## 11. Student Do: Case Study Inspiration Peer Review (10 min)

**Instructions**
Students should partner up with a classmate and share their mood board with their neighbor. They should walk their neighbor through their mood board and the choices they made.

- Monitor student groups during this activity. If a group needs help, provide support.

## 12. Instructor Do: How to Structure a Case Study (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to educate students on how to structure a case study for a design portfolio. This lecture further supports the final learning objective of the day, which is to have students create case study assets.

Now that students understand what works and doesn't work in a case study, go deeper and show them how case studies are organized. We want them to see that the structure of a case study is what makes it effective. Afterward, students will dive into a case study planning activity.

**Rules for Structuring a Case Study**

Case studies should be displayed in a way that is scannable and easy to follow. Include relevant photos and screenshots that tell the story, such as early sketches, whiteboards, research documentation, or final images. In addition to visuals for each project, create a case study that includes the following:

1. The problem(s) you had to solve or the hypothesis you came up with for solving it
2. Your specific role in the project and how you collaborated with others
3. How you came to your proposed solution(s)
4. How your proposed solution(s) solved the problem
5. Challenges you faced, including design concepts that were ultimately not pursued
6. How the project affected the users and the business
7. What you learned

**Goal: Tell a Story**

- Who is the client, target organization, or industry?
- Was this a team effort or a solo project? If you were working with a team, what was your role? What were the other roles involved?
- Who is the end-user? What user personas are you designing for?

**Review the quote from Sarah Bellrichard, Senior Vice President of Wholesale Internet Solutions and UX at Wells Fargo.**

Emphasize that a portfolio must "Tell me how you navigate from start to end of a project."

**How Real-World Designers Gather Inspiration for Case Studies**

UX/UI designers spend a *considerable amount of time* building case studies for their portfolios. Why? They know from experience that when a case study communicates, they get the job.

Polished case studies are how professional designers advance in their careers.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share with students how much time you've spent crafting case studies for your portfolio. Reinforce that case studies are the "language" all designers use to talk about their work.
>
> - Ask a TA to share what part of their online portfolio they have spent the most time crafting.

Building a case study that tells a story takes time. It takes work. It's worth it.

**Divide Your Case Study Into Two Parts**

- Students should create an executive summary of the project and then follow that with a detailed explanation of their design process.

**Review the quote from Laura Klein, author of *Build Better Products* and *UX for Lean Startups*.**

- Laura Klein is a thought leader in the world of UX design.

- **TAs, Slack out:** [UX for Lean Startups](https://www.amazon.com/UX-Lean-Startups-Experience-Research/dp/1492049581/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=lean+ux&qid=1583189368&sr=8-4)

**Review the summary example.**
The students should set up their stories by writing a two- to three-sentence summary of the product and how it works.

- Define the problem/objective.
- Define the solution.
- Define how the student contributed to the project.

**Explain the process in the case study.**

Always start with some user research that frames the problem. For example, perhaps write the following:

- “We analyzed the to-do lists of 140 users ages 18-40 for a period of three weeks and discovered that about 60% of their tasks were location-dependent. From this analysis, we made four user personas and defined their experiences in managing to-do lists with customer journey maps.”

**Show the deliverables with purpose.**

- The student's design process should drive the deliverables he or she shares.

**Use captions for artifacts.**

- Label screens—don’t assume the audience members know what they're looking at.

**Share the media documenting the process.**

- Show the sketches and iterations, not just the polished final solution.

**Show off the final solution.**

- Don’t hide the clickable prototypes. It pays to let the audience use the solution.

**End with a conclusion.**

End with a conclusion sharing what the student learned. This last part shows the final answer to the original question. It’s not enough here simply to show the final deliverable. In this section, demonstrate impact—how did the student's designed product improve the situation?

- Highlight the lessons the student learned to show that he or she later reflected on the experience.
- What would the student do differently if he or she had more time or resources to spend on the project?
- Complete his or her story by leaving the audience with a good sense of the student's role and potential.

Now it's time for students to practice planning their own case studies—that's next!

## 13. Student Do: Case Study Activity (40 min)

**TAs,** Slack out to students the following file:
[16-Week/02-Activities/16.1/16.1-04-UX-Case-Study-Outline-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ieF7CNcgpezhwri3TKP7sDn8sYExYv4SK-Hg_Va_F7o)

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor students during this activity to be sure they're making progress and review their outlines.

**Summary**

Here, students will practice planning their portfolio case studies and iterating on their existing projects.

**Instructions**

- Set a 40-minute timer.

**Deliverable**

Students will create an outline in Google Docs or another format. Ask students to share their outlines with you and the TAs for feedback and any annotations.

## 14. Instructor Do: Case Study Review (15 min)

Call the class back to attention for a short review.

Instructions:

1. Ask, **"Who wants to present their work?"**
2. Invite that student to present his or her work to class.
3. Have the class walk through the student's work.
4. Critique the student's work.
5. Thank the student for sharing.
6. If there is time, ask another student to share his or her work.

- Review any overarching questions and offer closing thoughts.

## 15. Instructor Do: Recap and Introduce Portfolio Homework (5 min)

- **Say,** "You're getting closer to completing the UX/UI Boot Camp and finishing your portfolios to share with potential employers. It seems like an overwhelming task, right? I can imagine you saying, "There's so much to do! How do I know what to build? Where do I start?"

- **Say,** "The homework this week will serve you in good stead for the rest of the boot camp and beyond. The reality is that your portfolio is never really done."

**This Week's Deliverable**

- This week we’ll continue iterating on the work started in class. Students will work to design a responsive homepage mockup for their portfolios along with two case studies to get them ready for their portfolios.

- **Why a portfolio?** So they can get a job in UX, UI, product design, or web design.

- TAs, share homework: [16-Week/04-Homework/01-Instructions/16 Unit Homework Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zCu1EOVi0bMrHJ-LGOmXSpeYdWc-3WNosb9mKTIBlgk).

- Say, **"We did a lot today. Keep making progress. Keep working on your tasks at home and bring your improvements in the next class."**

Remind students that you're available for office hours after class.

Wish everyone a good night.
