# 16.2 Lesson Plan: UX/UI Portfolio, Day 2

## Overview

In this class, students will use their work from the previous class to sketch a wireframe for their UX portfolio homepage, sketch a wireframe for a UX case study, start a 60-/120-day action plan for their job hunt, and start a skills inventory.

All of the activities started in class will extend into students' homework.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:
1. Create a homepage UX portfolio wireframe.

2. Create a UX case study wireframe.

3. Execute a 60-/120-day action plan in preparation for job hunting.

4. Conduct a self-inventory to assess their job-related skills.

## Class at a Glance

This is an activity-heavy class. Students will spend most of today's class working on wireframes for their portfolios and job preparation materials.

Your goal is to communicate the interview process to students and to share how you prepare for interviews and approach job interviews.

## Preparing for Class

- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [16-Week/01-Slides/16.2 Portfolio Week, Day 2 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rhwFCSL-G-Q3Cs8JwNm-KDh3OpB9J-F8iws0hzcJqKE).

- Make a copy of the Google slides to share with students and teaching assistants (TAs). Feel free to add minor updates to fit your own style, but you're required to cover the same UX concepts and activities.

- Share your copy of the slides with the TAs who will save it as a PDF and add it to the class's GitLab repository.

- Prepare a few professional anecdotes relating to today's topics—wireframing and job preparation—in order to connect these topics to the real world for students.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

### Student Materials

Students will need access to their deliverables and slides from previous homework case studies and group projects.

## Time Tracker

- Have your TAs reference the [16-Week/03-Time Trackers/16.2 Time Tracker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SmL7D-SO8MfdCEBNOGCSxiunJQ1dDFZvyQGHi9j1V28) to help keep track of time during class.

Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome the Class (2 min)

- Open up the [16-Week/01-Slides/16.2 Portfolio Case Study Day 2 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rhwFCSL-G-Q3Cs8JwNm-KDh3OpB9J-F8iws0hzcJqKE).

  - Remind students that they will need to gather all their UX/UI Boot Camp work in order to create their portfolios.

> :briefcase: **Connect the value of portfolios to the real world.** Take a moment to talk about the role of portfolios in the design field and what a portfolio communicates to hiring managers. Point out that portfolios are crucial for designers at every stage of their careers, not just the beginning. The portfolio is going to be the student's proof of product. Employers are going to look at student's portfolios and decide whether they can contribute to their company.

**What to Expect**
While UX is a relatively new field and growing rapidly, the UX hiring process is pretty uniform. Sometimes it can be a little messy.

The typical interview process follows five steps:

1. Phone screen:

   - This usually takes place with a recruiter.
   - It lasts 60 minutes or less.
   - The goal is to understand your qualifications and what you are looking for.
   - You don’t want to get too techy with a phone screen. HR recruiters probably don’t understand as much UX/UI lingo as you’d think. Their goal is to make sure that you have all the skills that their employer is looking for.
 
2. Phone interview:

   - This is a phone interview with a member of the design team.
   - It lasts about an hour.
   - The goal is to assess if you are a culture fit.
   - The secondary goal is to assess your process by reviewing some of your online portfolios.
      - You will usually talk through one to two projects from your online portfolio.

3. Design challenge:

   - This can happen in-person or at home.
   - If it's an on-site interview, it's going to be a whiteboard challenge.
   - At home, you usually have more time, but the expectation for what you produce is robust.
   - If you make it to this stage, you are in a good position.

4. On-site interview:

   - This is when you'll meet the team.
   - The goal is to assess your portfolio and discuss the take-home project that you completed. 
   - It can last a half-day to a full day.
   - It's longer if you have to do a whiteboard challenge.
   - You may have an hour of portfolio review where you want to bring a more detailed PDF of your design process.
   - At this point, the company is close to deciding between a few candidates, so be proud you made it to this point.

5. Offers and negotiation:

   - If the stars align, you'll begin the negotiation process.
   - This is difficult terrain for many.
   - We always recommend making a budget to figure out what you need to survive.
   - We also recommend looking on websites such as glassdoor.com to compare what people usually make for the role and title you have applied for.
   - Students can work with their career directors to prepare for the technical and non-technical interviews. Students can:
      - Schedule a coaching call with their career director.
      - Sign up for a career services workshop.

Review

## SLIDE 15
Portfolios should make a great first impression and be easy to find: 

- Make sure your portfolio is ready to go because you want and need it to make a great impression.
   - This means that all of your links work. 
   - You have at least three to six projects. 
   - You have an About Me page that discusses who you would like to be in the industry. 
   - You have a Contact Me page with your LinkedIn and email address. 

## SLIDE 16
- Update your resume and LinkedIn profile. These should match and speak to the journey that makes you unique and valuable to the marketplace.
- Dress the part... this may depend on the org.

## SLIDE 17
    - Take advantage of networking: The best way to find a job is to find a friend who knows a job. Breaking into a new industry is never easy and requires a lot of hustle. Meetup.com is a great resource for finding industry-specific events.

## SLIDE 18
  **Remember Companies are Looking for You**

- Hiring is an expensive cost for companies. They are looking for candidates such as yourself. It’s important that you sell yourself as the solution to their problem: finding quality designers.

- Make it worth it for your potential employer.

  - Be punctual.
  - Ask good questions.
  - Share personal experiences.
  - Add why design is meaningful.
  - Emphasize how you will help the team.

- Say, **"We did a lot today. Keep making progress. Keep working on your tasks at home and bring your improvements in the next class."**.

Wish everyone a good night.
