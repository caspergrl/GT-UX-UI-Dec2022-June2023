# 16.2 Lesson Plan: UX/UI Portfolio, Day 2

## Overview

In this class, students will use their work from the previous class to sketch a wireframe for their UX portfolio homepage, sketch a wireframe for a UX case study, start a 60-/120-day action plan for their job hunt, and start a skills inventory.

All of the activities started in class will extend into students' homework.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:
1. Create a homepage UX portfolio wireframe.

2. Create a UX case study wireframe.

3. Execute a 60-/120-day action plan in preparation for job hunting.

4. Conduct a self-inventory to assess their job-related skills.

## Class at a Glance

This is an activity-heavy class. Students will spend most of today's class working on wireframes for their portfolios and job preparation materials.

Your goal is to communicate the interview process to students and to share how you prepare for interviews and approach job interviews.

## Preparing for Class

- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [16-Week/01-Slides/16.2 Portfolio Week, Day 2 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rhwFCSL-G-Q3Cs8JwNm-KDh3OpB9J-F8iws0hzcJqKE).

- Make a copy of the Google slides to share with students and teaching assistants (TAs). Feel free to add minor updates to fit your own style, but you're required to cover the same UX concepts and activities.

- Share your copy of the slides with the TAs who will save it as a PDF and add it to the class's GitLab repository.

- Prepare a few professional anecdotes relating to today's topics—wireframing and job preparation—in order to connect these topics to the real world for students.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

### Student Materials

Students will need access to their deliverables and slides from previous homework case studies and group projects.

## Time Tracker

- Have your TAs reference the [16-Week/03-Time Trackers/16.2 Time Tracker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SmL7D-SO8MfdCEBNOGCSxiunJQ1dDFZvyQGHi9j1V28) to help keep track of time during class.

Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome the Class (2 min)

- Open up the [16-Week/01-Slides/16.2 Portfolio Case Study Day 2 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rhwFCSL-G-Q3Cs8JwNm-KDh3OpB9J-F8iws0hzcJqKE).

  - Remind students that they will need to gather all their UX/UI Boot Camp work in order to create their portfolios.

> :briefcase: **Connect the value of portfolios to the real world.** Take a moment to talk about the role of portfolios in the design field and what a portfolio communicates to hiring managers. Point out that portfolios are crucial for designers at every stage of their careers, not just the beginning. The portfolio is going to be the student's proof of product. Employers are going to look at student's portfolios and decide whether they can contribute to their company. 

- Review the agenda for today.

## 2. Instructor Do: Portfolio Review (8 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to review the portfolio requirements discussed in the last class. You'll show students portfolio examples and talk through what should be on a homepage wireframe, as well as discuss a UX case study. This supports today's first and second learning objectives, creating a homepage UX portfolio wireframe and a wireframe for their case studies. 

In this first lecture, you'll generate excitement about portfolio creation by talking about layout and typical portfolio requirements. This transitions into a portfolio wireframe activity in which students get hands-on practice with portfolio creation. 

Say, "**Today, we will be creating wireframes for the homepages of our portfolios!**"

**Review the Examples of Typical Online Portfolio Layout**

Today, most design portfolios follow a similar layout. Web-based portfolios are the most common medium for designers. Resist the urge to go overboard on a flashy template. Your content should be the primary focus and your site should be easy to navigate and consume.

- **Share your portfolio!** Today is an ideal time to share what your online portfolio looks like with your students.

> :gem: **Instructor insight:** Connect students' assignments to their future—the portfolios they start building today are the portfolios that hiring managers will soon be looking at. Remember, students don't know what it's like to work in the design field yet; you can help them imagine it.

**Review Portfolio Requirements**
What should be on a homepage portfolio wireframe:

1. Your name, title, and photo
2. Three to five big, beautiful images of your projects
3. A short bio to highlight the most important information about yourself
4. Your social links
5. Your resume; people should download your UX designer resume from here
6. Your contact details, or even better, a contact form so people can reach out to you

**Review Case Study Requirements**
Case studies should also follow a similar layout.

1. Place a big hero image on the top with a title.
2. Explain the challenge.
3. Introduce the team and your role in it.
4. Tell your design process, step by step.
5. Use images that support the story.
6. Show the results.

>:gem: **Designer Insight.** Referring to your professional experiences, explain how pictures and deliverables are the "language" designers speak.

Now that they have a sense of the requirements for portfolios, it's time for students to put these ideas to the test with wireframing—that's next!  

## 3. Student Do: Portfolio Homepage Wireframe Activity (30 min)

**TAs,** Slack out to students the activity instructions: [16-Week/01-Activities/16.2/16.2-01-Portfolio-Wireframe](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L1tRCRmcrjiwRZG_T0SeriT3VjL9FWLTo7RBsFLY-k8).

>These activity instructions cover sections 3-5 of this LP.

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is for students to sketch a homepage portfolio wireframe using the mood board inspiration and About Me content they created in the previous class. They will continue working on this wireframe as part of this week's homework.

**Instructions**

Use pen and paper to sketch a homepage portfolio wireframe that includes the requirements listed in the activity.

## 4. Student Do: Portfolio Homepage Wireframe Peer Review (10 min)

For this peer review session, have students get into pairs and share their wireframe sketches with their partners.

## 5. Student Do: Portfolio Homepage Wireframe Iteration (10 min)

For this iteration step, ask students to consider their partner’s feedback, and then iterate their portfolio wireframes.

## 6. Instructor Do: Portfolio Homepage Wireframe Review (20 min)

Call the class to attention for a review.

Tell the students to take a photo of their work and post it in Slack.

**Instructions:**

1. **Ask, "Who wants to present his or her work?"**
2. Invite a student to present his or her work to the class.
3. Have the class walk through the student's work.
4. Critique the student's work and provide *actionable* feedback.
5. Thank the student for sharing.
6. Ask another student to come and share his or her work.
7. Repeat the critique process.

Critique is a powerful and misunderstood process. We hope students "get it" by now. Still, point out that:

- Critique isn't criticism.
- Critique is not about problem-solving.
- Practice active listening skills (tell them what you heard them say!).
- Focused feedback is quality feedback.

> :gem: **Instructor insight:** Tell the class how you got the hang of giving and receiving a design critique.

In the next activity, students will apply wireframing to another aspect of their portfolios: their case studies.

## 7. Student Do: Portfolio Case Study Wireframe Activity (20 min)

**TAs,** Slack out to students the activity instructions: [16-Week/01-Activities/16.2/16.2-02-Case-Study-Wireframe](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10M7zs_DEHlw_kMJ6AAdc93H0U2uEAo7yG2ijSt8LmYc).

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is for students to begin sketching a case study wireframe using the mood board inspiration and case study content they created in the previous class.

> **Note:** If students complete this activity early, encourage them to keep going since this activity is also homework.

**Instructions**

Students will use a pen/pencil and paper to sketch a case study wireframe that includes the requirements listed in the activity.

## 8. Break (15 min)

It's time for a break. 

Breaks are part of the learning process and help get the most out of every lesson. Encourage students to grab a snack, drink water, and to stretch their bodies—they should step outside, if possible. 

When students return, you'll talk about how to prepare for a job interview.

---

## 9. Instructor Do: Job and Interview Prep (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to educate students about the hiring process for designers. We will also provide tips on how to get prepared for job interviews. This lecture connects to today's third learning objective, to create a preparation plan for job hunting with 60- and 120-day goals.

Here you'll help manage students' expectations about design interviews. You want to arm students with tactical information so that they are more inspired and less afraid. Then they'll use the following activity to fill out their 60- and 120-day job hunt goals. 

Say, "**The interview process is a marathon not a sprint.**"

**What to Expect**
While UX is a relatively new field and growing rapidly, the UX hiring process is pretty uniform. Sometimes it can be a little messy.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** What do you wish you had known about the hiring process when you were first job seeking? Share the benefit of your hindsight with the class.
>
> - Ask TAs or even experienced students to add their own insights.

The typical interview process follows five steps:

1. Phone screen:

   - This usually takes place with a recruiter.
   - It lasts 60 minutes or less.
   - The goal is to understand your qualifications and what you are looking for.
   - You don’t want to get too techy with a phone screen. HR recruiters probably don’t understand as much UX/UI lingo as you’d think. Their goal is to make sure that you have all the skills that their employer is looking for.
 
2. Phone interview:

   - This is a phone interview with a member of the design team.
   - It lasts about an hour.
   - The goal is to assess if you are a culture fit.
   - The secondary goal is to assess your process by reviewing some of your online portfolios.
      - You will usually talk through one to two projects from your online portfolio.

3. Design challenge:

   - This can happen in-person or at home.
   - If it's an on-site interview, it's going to be a whiteboard challenge.
   - At home, you usually have more time, but the expectation for what you produce is robust.
   - If you make it to this stage, you are in a good position.

4. On-site interview:

   - This is when you'll meet the team.
   - The goal is to assess your portfolio and discuss the take-home project that you completed. 
   - It can last a half-day to a full day.
   - It's longer if you have to do a whiteboard challenge.
   - You may have an hour of portfolio review where you want to bring a more detailed PDF of your design process.
   - At this point, the company is close to deciding between a few candidates, so be proud you made it to this point.

5. Offers and negotiation:

   - If the stars align, you'll begin the negotiation process.
   - This is difficult terrain for many.
   - We always recommend making a budget to figure out what you need to survive.
   - We also recommend looking on websites such as glassdoor.com to compare what people usually make for the role and title you have applied for.
   - Students can work with their career directors to prepare for the technical and non-technical interviews. Students can:
      - Schedule a coaching call with their career director.
      - Sign up for a career services workshop. 

**Before you apply.**

- Make sure your portfolio is ready to go because you want and need it to make a great impression.
   - This means that all of your links work. 
   - You have at least three to six projects. 
   - You have an About Me page that discusses who you would like to be in the industry. 
   - You have a Contact Me page with your LinkedIn and email address. 

- Update your resume and LinkedIn profile. These should match and speak to the journey that makes you unique and valuable to the marketplace.

  - Ask, "How many of you have an up-to-date resume?"
      - You can submit your resume to Milestone 4 in BCS and a profile coach can help you with your resume. 

  - There are nine weeks left of the boot camp. If you start making progress now, you will be able to hit the ground running in your job search.

  - Ask, "How many of you have an up-to-date LinkedIn profile with easy access to your Portfolio?"
      - LinkedIn is the baseline for applying to jobs, and your portfolio should be easy to access.

  - Hiring managers DO NOT want to hunt for your work! No portfolio, no job. Period.

  - Encourage your students to complete the items for the next class.

    - Take advantage of networking: The best way to find a job is to find a friend who knows a job. Breaking into a new industry is never easy and requires a lot of hustle. Meetup.com is a great resource for finding industry-specific events.

  **Remember Companies are Looking for You**

- Hiring is an expensive cost for companies. They are looking for candidates such as yourself. It’s important that you sell yourself as the solution to their problem: finding quality designers.

- Make it worth it for your potential employer.

  - Be punctual.
  - Ask good questions.
  - Share personal experiences.
  - Add why design is meaningful.
  - Emphasize how you will help the team.

- There will be obstacles, but you can overcome them through preparation.

Take questions, then transition students to the job hunt goals planning activity.

## 10. Student Do: 60-/120-Day Action Plan Activity (15 min)

**TAs,** Slack out to students the activity instructions: [16-Week/01-Activities/16.2/16.2-03-60-120-Day-Action-Plan](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UwyaiykiQOeNS4fqYpRLyVlnfLb0kRTDgzMBcFusrqI).

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is for students to create a 60-/120-day action plan outlining the goals they wish to accomplish to support their future success.

**Why the 60-/120-Day Action Plan Is a Valuable Tool**

Emphasize the importance of planning in getting things done.

This is a tool to help you with short-term goal setting. Whether you realize it or not, by taking this class, you had a long-term goal: to explore a new career and get a new job.

Getting a new job isn't easy, and you are not guaranteed a job after graduation. You need to plan for success, and this is a tool to help you brainstorm what you need to do and list out the steps you will take on this journey.

## 11. Instructor Do: 60-/120-Day Action Plan Review (15 min)

Call the class to attention for a review.

Tell the students to share both their 60-/120-day action plan in Slack.

1. **Ask, "Who wants to present his or her work?"**
2. Invite a student to present his or her work to the class.
3. Have the class walk through the student's work.
4. Critique the student's work.
5. Thank the student for sharing.
6. Ask another student to come up and share his or her work.
7. Repeat the critique process.

## 12. Instructor Do: How to Prepare for and Ace the Interview (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to educate students about strategies they can use to prepare for a phone or on-site interview. This supports the final learning objective of the day, to do a self-assessment of their skills. 

This final lecture of the day is all about tactically preparing for an interview. This lecture is followed by a skills assessment activity. The hope is they will feel confident about how many skills they've acquired! 

**Get Prepared by Getting Detailed Oriented**

During each step of the hiring process, you want to prepare yourself so you have the best chance of success.

1. During the phone screen:

   - Know the company and the job description.
   - Know what value you would like to bring to the company.
   - Be prepared to talk about the skills that you have; whether they are UX/UI skills or soft skills, all skills are important. 


2. During the phone interview:

   - Know the interviewers and the product.
   - Come up with ideas on how you can improve the product with your unique set of skills. 
   - Understand the company culture. 
   - Bring questions to ask the hiring manager. 
   - Be able to talk about your projects. 


4. During the on-site interview:

   - Know your work. Understand the company's approach to design.

5. During the offer and negotiation:

   - Know your worth, values, needs numbers, and deal-breakers.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Help students appreciate the value of being "themselves" in interviews. Share your insight into how important it is to let hiring managers see your passion!

**Review the following tips for the interview process:**

- Get to know the job description.
- Get to know the job interviewers.
- Get to know the design process.
- Get to know your work.
- Get to know your worth.

**Review the following tips on how to ace the interview:**

- Gauge the design skills of the interviewer.
- Be clear on your skills.
- Review the routine interview questions.
- Review the annoying basic UX design questions.
- Know your most significant accomplishment.
- Portfolio review questions.
- Be able to justify everything.
- What if you are a new designer?

> :gem: **Instructor insight:** Before students dive into their last activity, help them connect the idea of doing a skills inventory to their goals in the real world. It's easy to overlook what you know: students are in the thick of a boot camp and sometimes forget *how many skills* they've gained!
>
> These skills will go into their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and be talked about in job interviews, too.

Now to take their preparation even further, it's time for students to inventory their skills—the final activity of the day. 

## 13. Student Do: My Skills Inventory Activity (10 min)

**TAs,** Slack out to students the activity instructions: [16-Week/01-Activities/16.2/16.2-04-My-Skills-Inventory](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Tw6WVdmJiSSTVtPs6Wz5Z8Z8EeOwYVBRUdLoVEuB3d0).

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is for students to begin an inventory of the skills they have developed during the UX/UI Boot Camp.

Be sure to remind students to continue working on their skills inventory at home. 

**Support students as they work.** 

Monitor students and ask them if they're unclear on what skills to include. Some students might need help determining whether a particular skill is a "strength" versus something they enjoy doing.

## 14. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (3 min)

- Say, **"We did a lot today. Keep making progress. Keep working on your tasks at home and bring your improvements in the next class."**.
- If you would like to practice more behavioral or whiteboarding interviews, email your career directors on how you can become more employer competitive. They have a plethora of resources and can help you prepare for your job search. 

Take any final questions. 

Remind students that you're available for office hours after class.

Wish everyone a good night.
