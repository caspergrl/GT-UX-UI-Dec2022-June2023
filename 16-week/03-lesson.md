# 16.3 Lesson Plan: Design Challenges

## Overview

The goal of today's lesson is to help students become interview-ready, specifically in terms of conducting a design challenge as part of the interview process.

To prepare, your students will review how to present their work, learn a framework for approaching a design challenge and use it to complete a design challenge. Then they will begin setting up their coding environment for next week.

## Learning Objectives

After today's lessons, students will be able to:

1. Articulate the importance of presenting design work during job interviews.
2. Complete a whiteboard design challenge framework.
3. Execute a design challenge canvas as practice for job interviews.
4. Articulate the value of being code conversational as a designer.
5. Create their first GitHub repo.

## Class at a Glance

Today's lesson has three parts:

1. In the first part of the class, students will present their work, receive critique, and practice a whiteboard design challenge.
2. In the second part of the class, we'll introduce students to code tools and why they'll learn to code.
3. Third, students will create their first GitHub repo. *You'll give a demonstration of GitHub and how a repo works in Section 11*.

## Preparing for Class

- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [16-Week/01-Slides/16.3 Portfolio Case Study Day 3 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hd1u1otuGmIAsVjGJqvJZF23RcVMVkce5KM5_OE7K4I).

 - Make a copy of the slides to share with students and the teaching assistants (TAs). Feel free to add minor updates to fit your own style, but you're required to cover the same UX concepts and activities.

- Share your copy of the slides with the TAs who will save it as a PDF and add it to the class's GitLab repository.

- Since you'll give a demo of GitHub in the third part of this lesson, be sure to run through it in advance, especially if you're not very familiar with GitHub.

- Come up with a few professional anecdotes that you can share that will help students connect the work they do today with their own professional futures in design.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Have your TAs reference the [16-Week/03-Time Trackers/16.3 Time Tracker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1M_NVpQ9PPpgwmjQQcJBUxeCbHIGDq007STlYZvcweFM) to help keep track of time during class.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Preparing to Teach Weeks 17-21

After today's lesson, you will transition into the front-end web development weeks. The following notes are intended to help you prepare for that transition.

**Helping Students Program**

- Many students are going to be nervous about getting into programming. Some may even have impostor syndrome. Reassure students who are feeling this way that it's normal and will pass. After all, they are learning a new language.

  - Be sure to mention that the best way to feel more comfortable working with code is to code! Every coder working today had to start coding at some point. Your students are no different from them. Practice makes perfect; the best way to get rid of impostor syndrome is to practice.

**Download Key Tools**

- Be sure you have the following tools on your computer (if you don't already):
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

**Your Computer Setup**

- ***Design a setup for teaching that works for you:***
  - During the coding portion of the lecture, some instructors choose to mirror their laptop screen for the projector so that students can watch them code.
  - Other instructors have used different methods to help them facilitate coding, such as an additional laptop, iPad, or phone to review the materials during the lecture.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome the Class (2 min)

- Open the [16-Week/01-Slides/16.3: Portfolio Week, Day 3](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hd1u1otuGmIAsVjGJqvJZF23RcVMVkce5KM5_OE7K4I) slide show provided as an initial guide for today's class.

  - Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.

## SLIDE 6
**Designers must be able to talk about their work.**
- However, your portfolio is not a script. You do not want to read your portfolio to people. You want to tell a story.

***TAs,*** Slack out to students the video "Prepare for Your Google Interview: UX Design" (c) 2019 #LifeAtGoogle:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7UpV6TnyOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7UpV6TnyOg).


## SLIDE 7
Share graphic designer Simon Johnston's quote about communication.


## SLIDE 8
**Say,** "Google's UX team will tell you the same thing."
Here are the top two tips from Google's UX team:

Tip No. 1: *Be able to explain your problem-solving thought process and answer questions about it, too.*

Tip No. 2: *Practice your presentation.*

## SLIDE 9
**Reddit Portfolio Example**
Imagine a project in your portfolio is a user research and prototyping project you did for Reddit.

## SLIDE 10
**What Not to Say**

"When I was at Reddit, I worked on this project to increase advertising revenue for the company.

"We followed a design sprint process.

"On the first day, we did the "How Might We..." activity where we all wrote Post-it notes to explore how we might fix the problems of users not engaging with ads on the site. After we wrote all our "How Might We..." Post-its, we took 10 minutes and voted.

"Then we identified where there were trends and overlap, and we decided on which “How Might We...” we would pursue."


## SLIDE 11
**Why This Is Not Good Communication**

1. It doesn't narrate what you did.
2. It doesn't communicate what you were thinking and why you made important decisions.
3. It doesn't demonstrate insightful thinking.
4. It is not captivating.
5. It sets the tone for how you would communicate as part of the team.


## SLIDE 12
**A Better Way to Tell the Story**
"When I was at Reddit, I worked on this project to increase advertising revenue for the company.

"It all began when the research team started to notice that a lot of new users got lost in the product and weren't clicking much on the ads. After looking at our analytics, we saw that the user's click-through rate was low on ads across the entire user base.

"To help us understand the 'why' behind those numbers, we decided to do a 1:1 interview and group discussions with existing and new users of Reddit. Our goal was to understand their experience with the product so that we could balance that with the goals of the business.""


## SLIDE 13
**Use Anecdotes and Insights to Tell the Story**

1. What did you learn from the product?
2. What would you do differently if you could start over?
3. What went well? What didn't go well?
4. What would be prioritized to continue the project?
5. Were there any exceptional outcomes? Testimonials? Feedback?

Before moving on to the presentations, ask two to three students to share about their prior experiences with using anecdotes to talk about their work.

## SLIDE 14
Review

## SLIDE 15
**What is a design challenge?** A design challenge is a short exercise that gauges a designer's design process and critical thinking skills. Once presented with a prompt, the designer must assess the problem, conceptualize a solution, and communicate their reasoning.

**When does a design challenge take place?**

- There are two types of design challenges: at home or in person.
- At-home design challenges can last 24 to 48 hours or longer.
- In-person design challenges last about an hour.

**Why do designers take a design challenge?**

In the "real world," hiring teams will test candidates:

- To ensure that they know their stuff
- To see how they think on their feet
- To understand their thought process
- To examine how they collaborate with others
- To see how they respond to stress
- To understand their “design process”

## SLIDE 16
**What are interviewers looking for?**

- How you go through your thinking process when solving a problem
- How you communicate your approach to the problem
- What questions you ask
- How you solve the problem for the user and the constraints that you're designing for

## SLIDE 17
Review

## SLIDE 18
**Design Challenge Strategy**

1. Identify the problem or task.
2. Understand the users.
3. Map out the existing solution or task.
4. Identify flaws with the existing solution.
5. Brainstorm new solutions.
6. Critique these new solutions to determine one possible direction.


## SLIDE 19
**Five Steps to Take During a Design Challenge**

Review the five steps to approaching a design challenge.

1. Ask clarifying questions about the problem.
2. Write key information about the users to develop a persona.
3. Sketch out the existing user flow.
4. Sketch a new user flow that addresses the problems.
5. Sketch screens to reflect solution.

## SLIDE 20
**Tips for Design Exercises**

1. Don't be afraid to ask questions.

   - Get clarity. Ask follow-up questions. Try to make the challenge a discussion with your interviewers. Pretend you are all working on it together.

2. Think out loud.

   - Let people into your head. Even if you start going down the wrong path, recognize that and state why you’re not going to pursue an idea.

3. Always check your solution against the problem.

   - Constantly refer back to the original problem and your proto-personas to find out “is this solution truly solving the problem?”

4. Aim for a lot of ideas.

   - Don’t try to draw detailed wireframes. Focus on the major differences in each concept and key content or features of each.

5. Explore competitors or similar products.

   - If you struggle with ideas, think about a product that is similar and go down a route where you compare the product to a competitor's.


## SLIDE 21
**Design Exercise Dos and Don'ts**

DOs... It is okay to:

- Assume—just acknowledge it.
- Mess up—just erase it and move on.
- Ask for help—be honest.
- Roleplay—have the interviewer act as the end user.

DON'Ts:

- Don't just start sketching!
- Don't hesitate to use the whiteboard!
- Don't design in silence.

Review

## SLIDE 23
**Review the Whiteboard Challenge Canvas**

- It is a method for dividing space to quickly articulate all the things we have taught in this boot camp and more.
- Whiteboarding is done in real-time during an interview, and it is hard to hide your skills when you're being asked to execute them.
- Practicing this will make you less nervous during an interview.

## SLIDE 24
The framework for this canvas follows the following steps:

1. Ask questions.
2. Define the problem/goal.
3. Define users/needs.
4. Understand the context/constraints.
5. Generate ideas.
6. Write a task list/user flow.
7. Create sketches.
8. Define success metrics.
9. Write down assumptions made during the challenge.

## SLIDE 25
This framework is composed of five main sections:

1. **The Goal of the Exercise**

   - At the very top of the whiteboard you should write down the ultimate goal of the session—the objective you’re trying to achieve.

   - Questions to ask:
     - What is the ultimate purpose of doing this exercise?
     - Let’s say we had an outstanding session. What did we accomplish? Why did it work?
     - How can we know that an objective is the right one to pursue?
     - How will we know if this is true?

## SLIDES 26-27
Review Steps 1-2

## SLIDE 28
2. **The User Persona**

   - The best next step is to bring the user into the conversation by asking the participants what assumptions are being made around the target users.

   -  Questions to ask:
      - What are our user groups?
      - Who is the primary persona?
      - What are some current behaviors they’re performing?
      - What motivates them?
      - How do they measure success?
      - What is getting in the middle of them and achieving their goals?

## SLIDE 29
Review Step 3

## SLIDE 30
3. **The Problem Space**

   - While advocating for the user might be one of our top priorities, it is only a third of the problem. Within the problem space, you should explore the context in which the behaviors are performed, the business goals the organization is trying to accomplish while building the product, and the technical constraints.

   - Questions to ask:
     - What is the context of use?
     - Where do the behaviors happen?
     - What information does the user have at hand?
     - What would be some device/artifact constraints?
     - What are the business objectives behind the solution?
     - What are the technical constraints that the team has or could face in the future?

## SLIDE 31
Review step 4

## SLIDE 32
4. **Assumptions**

   - By considering the main goal, user groups, business goals, and technical constraints, the team should have found insights that might feel risky not to validate. These insights can be written in the assumptions section.


## SLIDE 33
Review step 5

## SLIDE 34
5. **Solution space**

   - If you’ve considered the previous steps before starting to propose solutions, you will feel more confident about the solutions you start sketching on the whiteboard. Start with a high-level journey of the user accomplishing the main goal and discuss the minimum steps it might take to reach such a milestone. If you feel confident enough with the scenario followed, you can start exploring interface components, layouts, and interactions.

  - If you have a personal story of whiteboarding during an interview, share it, but keep it brief.

Now for the road test! Students are going to jump into a design challenge of their own in the following activity.

## SLIDE 44
## 5. Student Do: Whiteboard Design Challenge Activity (50 min)

**TAs,** Slack out to students the following file:
[16-Week/02-Activities/16.3/16.3-02-Design-Challenge-Canvas-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=120eLDWlgpmWtRju6pteTPQCYw1du0wplFtqGPKEiYHI).

- Instructors: Begin pairing off students.

- Have students split up whiteboard space or get out large sheets of paper.

- TAs: During this time, work with groups as though you were "one of their team members" in sessions of 20 minutes each. In essence, treat yourselves as "UX leads" floating among teams.

**Summary**

Here, students will get practice with an industry interview technique.

If students are struggling, you may want to skip the review to give them more time to finish the activity.

**Instructions**

- Set a 50-minute timer.

**Support students as they work:** Monitor students during this activity to be sure they're getting into pairs and have whiteboard space or large sheets of paper to practice the whiteboarding challenge.

**If students finish early,** there is a second design challenge prompt in Part 2 of the activity document. Have students start that challenge.

## SLIDE 45
## 6. Instructor Do: Whiteboard Design Challenge Review (10 min)

Use this review section for students to solicit feedback on their work, give feedback, and come away with actionable steps for iteration.

- Ask, **"Does anyone want to share their canvas solution?"**
- Have a group come to the front and quickly talk through their design challenge.

Lead your class in a review of their whiteboard work. Encourage students to consider the following questions to reflect on their classmates' work as well as their own:

- What worked?
- What could be improved?
- What did you learn?

Next, invite students to take a break and relax a bit. When they return from break, you'll shift gears completely and introduce the class to GitHub.

## SLIDE 48
Front-end development is:

- The practice of building the client-facing section of webpages and user interfaces.
- Front-end developers build the parts of the web that users see and interact with.
- Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build rich interfaces that are pleasing to the eye.

## SLIDE 49
**Why do I need to know front-end development?**
"Don't they have people hired to program it for me? I want to be a UX designer."

Believe it or not, this is a common sentiment among people new to the UX community.

## SLIDE 50
Review

## SLIDE 51
Why Learn Front-End Development?:
- Understanding the medium you are designing for helps create better user interfaces. How can you make a realistic design if you don't know what is realistically possible with the programming languages used?

## SLIDE 52
- As a UX designer, you *will* be working with developers to implement your design. Being able to communicate your ideas effectively to developers is essential to getting a pixel-perfect design.

- You need to know how to code so you can recommend and design ideas based on feasible solutions. You know if the solutions are feasible because you have had experience in the programming language.

- Many UX jobs require development experience for more senior-level roles as working knowledge of the medium you are designing for helps to make UX calls.

## SLIDE 53
**Do designers need to know how to code?**
Short answer: **Yes.**

## SLIDE 54
***"Code conversational"*** is knowing *how* HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS are used to build sites—well enough to have a conversation about with a coder about site design.

## SLIDE 55
Review

## SLIDE 56
**Many job postings request knowledge of code.**

The majority of UX job descriptions have four requirements that make knowing front-end development invaluable:

1. Understanding the technical implications of UX/UI decisions.

2. Ability to communicate clearly and effectively with members of the development team and business stakeholders (this could be your boss or the owner).

3. Working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

4. Some development experience for the more senior-level UX roles.

## SLIDE 57
**How much code do UX/UI designers need to know?**

- **Answer:** At a base level, you need to understand what is possible to do in your design. As creatives, it is very easy to design something that would either require too much development time or is not technically feasible with web technologies. A UI developer needs to be a functional front-end developer. You need to be able to make beautiful responsive layouts as well as be able to do solid UI design work.

**Do I need to know how to program mobile apps?**

- ***Answer:*** No. Mobile app developers are usually software engineers that specialize in app languages for the platform they develop on. However, the technologies used in the mobile app—some make use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—may make learning the skills we talk about in this class relevant.

## SLIDE 58
## 9. Student Do: Software Check Activity (8 min)

**TAs,** Slack out the activity file: [16-Week/02-Activities/16.3/16.3-03-Software Check Activity Instructions Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18gU1yuX5Mxi9laknwZdx7Hd3p_4z1sZ9N1u2JNPRLyk).

**Why this activity?**

Before students can dive into the basics of HTML, we need to make sure we have the right tools for the job.

The tools students are installing today are used by professionals and companies worldwide. If you code in any way, shape, or form, you will encounter GitHub and Visual Studio Code.

**If students finish early:**

- Once students verify their software is in good shape, challenge them to play around and/or watch a GitHub or VS Code how-to video and try out their new tools.

## SLIDE 59
Review

## SLIDE 60
**What is version control?**

- Version control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large websites, and other collections of information.
  - Version control saves all the previous changes you make to a file in "commits." Each commit has a unique number that you can use to see how your project has changed over time.
  - This means that projects that are tracked by Git can roll back to previous versions. Having a backup is especially useful if you post incorrect code up to your production server and need to roll it back.

## SLIDE 61
**What is GitHub?**

Here you'll introduce GitHub, the tool students will use to publish their webpages and sites, and one which more and more designers are also using.

**Justifying GitHub**

The goal of this section is to justify the use of Git to designers who, up to this point, might not see much value in using developer tools.

***Say,*** "As with any new tool, GitHub will take some practice."

- GitHub is software that is used for version control. It is free and open source.

- Why Git?

  - It is a version control system that allows team members (developers, UX, UI) to collaborate without overriding each other’s work.

- Git is not easy and has a lot of developer jargon, but we will spend some time getting used to it!

## SLIDE 62
- GitHub is also a valuable skill to have as a UX/UI designer and can be the difference between candidates for open roles. It is common for UX/UI designers to be embedded in dev teams and work on front-end code. Having a base understanding of Git will help you stand out for these roles.

Take any questions before moving onto your demo. After your GitHub demo, students will create their first GitHub repo.

## SLIDE 63
## 11. Instructor Do: GitHub Desktop Demo (8 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal for this demo is to instill confidence in students who might be creating their first GitHub repositories and commits.

Remind students that you and the TAs will be able to answer their questions when it's time for them to try this on their own.

***Say,*** "This demo will give you a general feel for how GitHub works. Don't worry about getting it. GitHub will click over time with practice."

**Instructions**

1. Go to [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com)

   - Create a new repository.

   ![Step 1](Images/1.png)
   ![Step 2](Images/2.png)

2. Make sure you set your repo to public.
3. Create your repo.

   ![Step 3](Images/3.png)

4. Search for your repo in GitHub Desktops UI! Remember what you named it?
5. Clone your repo to your local machine.

   ![Step 4](Images/4.png)

6. Choose where you want to save the repository in your local directory. Make sure you choose a spot you are going to remember. Then click clone.

   ![Step 5](Images/5.png)

7. Drag the files you want to upload to the cloud into the folder you cloned. Make sure your root file is named index.html, or GitHub won't load your page.

   ![Step 6](Images/6.png)

8. GitHub notices that you have changed the files in the repo and is now tracking it.

9. Enter a description of what is in this commit. Verbose descriptions help you remember what you pushed up each commit and help to backtrack if needed. Only the summary is required. The description is optional.

10. After you have entered your description, click commit to master.

Now it's time for students to practice creating a GitHub repo on their own (with your support)!

## SLIDE 64
## 12. Student Do: My First GitHub Repo Activity (12 min)

**TAs,** Slack out to students the activity file: [16-Week/03-Activities/16.3/16.3-04-GitHub-Repo-Activity](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RJpqPltupSIPEnPyRMYSmGBxJXKVms4j00vTrJNG5ow).

**Summary**

Understanding how to push code is important for students. Many companies are beginning to use GitHub to manage more than just code projects. In the following weeks, students will be using GitHub and GitHub desktop almost daily. They must begin practicing now.

**Instructions**

First, students will create a repository, then clone that repository. From there, they will open the GitHub Desktop tool and follow the instructions in the activity document.

> Note: Remind students that GitHub can sometimes take up to 15 minutes to make the changes.

**Deliverable**

Once completed, students will see their published webpage appear live on the web.

**Support students as they work.**

As promised, be on hand while students work with GitHub and be willing to demo how to create/clone/commit using GitHub, as needed.

Now that students are done uploading their newly created website to github.com, let's review some key concepts.

## 13. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (2 min)

- Say, **"We have done a lot this week, but keep making progress. Keep working on your portfolios until the end of the boot camp and establish a placeholder for your final project!"**

Remind students that you are available for office hours after class.

Wish everyone a good night.
