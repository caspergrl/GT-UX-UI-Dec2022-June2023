# 6.1 Lesson Plan: Group Project 1: Day 03

---

## Overview

Today, your class will start Week 2 of the Group Project 1 timeline. Student groups will continue working on Group Project 1's definition phase and begin the ideation phase. Students will focus on defining a problem and then ideation. 

Groups should make significant progress on their user research and user empathy deliverables as well as the definition phase of the design thinking process. 

You and the TAs will guide student groups through standups and Working Sessions in order to help them produce their deliverables.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Execute project planning by practicing a daily standup with project groups.
2. Define a problem statement.
3. Share constructive feedback on problem statements.
4. Conduct a competitor analysis.
5. Ideate potential solutions using the mind map or "I Like, I Wish, What If?" method.
6. Synthesize ideas down to one to three key features using a feature prioritization matrix.
7. Create a user scenario driven storyboard or a user journey map and get  constructive feedback on your
8. Receive constructive feedback on your group project 1 deliverables from the day from at least one instructor or TA.

## Class at a Glance

- Today is a working session for students. 
- Start off the day with a standup. 
- Observe and help student groups during their Work Sessions.  
- Students will be working through the definition and the ideation phase of their group project.

## Prepare for Class

- **Review the lecture slides:** [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/06.1-Group Project 01, Day 03 slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i5pPgefFkWLEDotxRU3jqckP0D32p80PXrqkdmNdWOY).

- Review the [How to Help Students Get Unstuck document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJKtoLw-7bYNvLxRSyUFso64-y0hStQGCOCXp22drPY/edit?usp=sharing) for helpful questions to ask during the working session.

- Students will often report anxiety around the feedback they receive from the instructional staff. Ease students' concerns by telling them that each instructor and each person will have a different perspective and this diversity of opinion is a good thing. As a UX designer in the workplace, it is our job to take feedback from many stakeholders and use that to mold our solutions.

- **Put on your coach hat:** Group Project 1 is more self-driven than in-class activities and students might not finish all of their design thinking deliverables on the schedule they planned as a team. If this happens, encourage students to complete their deliverables, particularly those used by the rest of the team. The goal is to get teams unblocked as quickly as possible. You can help them by encouraging students to execute, providing feedback and suggestions so that they feel they are on track for success.

- **Helping students get unstuck:** Students often struggle with the scope of a group project in the three-week timeline. Typically, this happens when students add too many features in their prototypes. Help them understand the problem with "feature creep" and the importance of being decisive about the features they're building. Help teams choose one feature in their prototype first. Remind them they only have about 10 minutes to present their process, so keeping it focused is important.

- **Remember:** ***Instructors and TAs should not be idle at their computers. You all should be engaging with students throughout the entire day.***

- At your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.

  - In these workshops, student groups will rotate between the instructor and TAs to get help on specific tasks. These workshops should be between 15 and 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

- > globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom and create breakout rooms to work with individual groups. Be creative here!


## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Encourage students to come early and use the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early to participate in office hours.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Objectives (5 min)

Welcome students to class. 

  > globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Engage students! Get them into a design mindset. Ask if anyone has come across an interesting design article or any cool industry news. You can share it too!

- Launch your lecture slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/06.1-Group Project 01, Day 03 slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i5pPgefFkWLEDotxRU3jqckP0D32p80PXrqkdmNdWOY).

- Today is about practicing the design thinking methodology. Student groups should be completing the first diamond of the process.

### Keep the enthusiasm and encouragement high.

- Individual groups might feel stressed about the pressure. Let them know that all boot camp students have felt that. Let them know that they can do it. How? One deliverable at a time. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share your personal experience. What's it like working on a project under tight deadlines? How about sharing responsibilities with team members?

Review today's learning objectives. 

- There are a lot of objectives to achieve and deliverables to create but reassure students that *not all deliverables* will get completed in class, and that's OK. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

Now, it's time to get to work!

## 2. Student Do: Daily Standup (10 min)

It's time for today's daily standup.

**Instructions:**

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Put students into the same groups and breakout rooms as last class.

1. Divide the class equally among the instructional staff.

2. In their breakout rooms, each group should address the following questions:

   - *What did I work on yesterday?*
   - *What am I working on today?*
   - *What issues are blocking me?*

3. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.

   - Assign TAs to those groups in order to help them get caught up.  

## 3. Student Do: Work Session 1 (60 min)

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Cut and paste a screenshot of the Deliverables slide and share in Slack.

- Set a timer for 60 minutes. 

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Put student groups into breakout rooms. 
- During the Work Session, support students groups by checking in on their design process. This could be reviewing their plan, discussing findings from user interview, or by reading their user insights. 

> **Instructor Note:** Ask a lot of questions about how groups got their information, what they plan to do with it, and how are they sharing it among their group.
> 
> With your TAs, make sure you are checking in with the groups. 

Once the session wraps up, everyone should take a break. 

## 4. Break (15 min) 

During a working session day, the break is for the instructional staff. But if working groups do need a break, they should take one. However, students shouldn't take a break if it interferes with workshops.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Don't stop sharing your screen! Put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual timer will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

## 5. Student Do: Work Session 2 (80 min)

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Cut and paste a screenshot of the Deliverables slide and share in Slack.

- Set a timer for 80 minutes. 

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Put student groups into breakout rooms. 

- During the Work Session, support groups by encouraging the design process and reinforcing the completion of the project requirements. 

> **Instructor Note:** Ask a lot of questions about how groups got their information, what they plan to do with it, and how are they sharing it among their group.
> 
> With your TAs, make sure you are checking in with the remaining groups. Each group should be checked in with by the end of class.

## 6. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Close all of the breakout rooms and bring everyone's attention back to your screen. 

- Ask everyone to wrap up their work. 

- Congratulate students! The teams have completed the first week of Group Project 1. Encourage students to keep up the great work and to keep making progress. 

> **Instructor Note:** Applaud students on the amount of work they've accomplished during this compressed project timeline. Keep the energy high and let them know they're doing a great job! Pressure over time creates a diamond.

- ***Let students know what's due before next class:***
  - Before the next class, students must complete all Day 3 tasks: [Group Project 1 Requirements document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y/edit#heading=h.6hggydw6dvip). 

- ***What teams should have accomplished today:***
- Define a problem statement.
    - Conduct competitor analysis.
    - Ideate or brainstorm using the mind map or “I wish, I Like, What If” method.
    - Synthesize your ideas down to one to three key features using a feature prioritization matrix.
    - Create a user journey map.
- If groups are still working on some of the deliverables, this is fine. But the work must be completed before the next class.  

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

- Thank everyone for doing their best work. 
- Remember, office hours are after class.
- Good night!
