# 6.3 Lesson Plan: Group Project 1, Day 5

---

## Overview

Today, students will continue working on Group Project 1. They'll iterate their low-fidelity prototypes and user testing.

Groups will work with each other to give feedback on their low-fidelity prototypes. Work with your TAs to make user testing organic and not a disruption to a team's progress.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Take part in a daily standup.
2. Build a clickable prototype in InVision, Adobe XD, or Figma.
3. Write a usability testing plan.
4. Conduct at least three user tests.
5. Analyze usability testing data.

## Class at a Glance

- Today is a working session for students. Be sure to conduct a standup, workshop with student groups throughout the class, and help students if they get stuck.
- If a group falls behind schedule, assign a TA to actively workshop with that group to get them back on track.

> **Time Management Tip:** Make sure each group has a 15-20-minute check-in with a minimum of one instructional staff member before the end of the day. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Ask students to sign up for the 15-20-minute time slots via Slack or Zoom chat.

## Prepare for Class

- **Using Zoom:** It takes time to become proficient using Zoom, the primary online instructional tool. Please refer to the following guide for help performing essential online teaching tasks (sharing screens, managing breakout rooms, etc.):
    - [Zoom Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MtogY4tO4aMPgQ0mlHpdtvi8rmkt9efN__mBngs9tg/edit)
    
- **Review the lecture slides:** [5-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/06.3-Project 1, Day 5 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ti24-iL1W6nQiekwG6EnwoIdiHdZPctjW8h0vIibUTc).

- Review the [How to Help Students Get Unstuck document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJKtoLw-7bYNvLxRSyUFso64-y0hStQGCOCXp22drPY/edit?usp=sharing) for questions to ask during the working session.

- **Important:** By the end of the day, students should have met most of the day's objectives and conducted user tests on their clickable prototypes.

- **Remember:** Instructors and TAs should not be idle at their computers. You should be engaging with students throughout the entire day.

- At your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.

  - In these workshops, student groups will rotate between the instructor and TAs to get help on specific tasks. These workshops should be between 10 and 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are moving in the right direction.

  - This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom and find small spaces to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

- If needed, review [Strategies for Class Online](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/ux-ui-curriculum-version2/tree/master/01-lesson-plans/06-Week#strategies-for-class-online).

## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Encourage students to log in early and use the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who show up early and participate in office hours.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Today's Objectives (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to get student groups into working mode and to keep the energy high for making progress. In the real world, the enthusiasm for one's team and the problems you're all solving goes a long way.

Welcome to class!

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Engage students! Get them into a design mindset. Ask if anyone has come across an interesting design article or any cool industry news. You can share, too!

- Launch your slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/06.3-Project 1, Day 5 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ti24-iL1W6nQiekwG6EnwoIdiHdZPctjW8h0vIibUTc).

- First, let students know what today holds. Today's in-class Group Project 1 working session mirrors the "real world." This means that students will need to execute as a team. 
  - Today is an opportunity to keep making progress.
  - Remind students of how valuable iterations are. Iteration is fundamental to the design process. Students should be capturing their work along the way—screenshots and photos.

:gem: **Designer Insight:** Briefly share an anecdote with a focus on iteration. This will help them prepare for today's group work. 

- Finally, review today's objectives. 

Next, it's time for the daily standup!

## 2. Student Do: Daily Standup (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Create breakout rooms for student groups. One instructional staff member should observe each group, and it's best to use the same groups as last class. 

- Pay attention to students' "today" tasks. Each group should have ample tasks.

**Instructions:**

1. Each group should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

2. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.

   - Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

Next, review how the standups went in a quick review—that's your next two minutes!

## 3. Instructor Do: Review (2 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: TAs can use a breakout room to address blockers. Help groups focus and collaborate on resolving those blockers.

**Blockers:** With TAs, help any groups that have blocked team members. 

Now it's time for students to dig into today's tasks with a Work Session—which runs an hour!

## 4. Student Do: Work Session 1 (60 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to support students as they make progress on Group Project 1. Students should be moving into UX low-fidelity prototyping. Help by providing feedback and push students to iterate and test their prototype as a team.

**Important:** Be sure students can easily refer to the Deliverables. Either leave that slide up on your screen or cut and paste a snapshot of it into Slack.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Cut and paste a screen shot of the Deliverables slide and share in Slack.

> Note: Today is going to require user testing. Encourage groups to work together to give each other feedback. Have teams that are at the same level of progress critique one another.   
> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Put student groups into breakout rooms to align students at the same point of progress into groups for critique and feedback.

## 5. Break (15 min)

During a working session day, the break is for the instructional staff. But if working groups do need a break, they should take one. However, students shouldn't take a break if it interferes with
workshops.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Don't stop sharing your screen! Put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual timer will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

### After break:

Students will make further progress on their tasks. Their second Work Session runs one hour and twenty minutes!

## 6. Student Do: Work Session 2 (80 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to get students to test and iterate their low-fidelity prototypes.

### Before students begin: 

Review the list of today's deliverables so students can measure their progress. 

- Remind students about the objectives for Group Project 1 and celebrate their progress.

**Important:** Be sure students can easily refer to the Deliverables. Either leave that slide up on your screen or cut and paste a snapshot of it into Slack.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Put student groups into breakout rooms

- Set a timer for 80 min. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Cut and paste a screen shot of the Deliverables slide and share in Slack.

Next, engage students a review of their group project work. 

## 7. Instructor Do: Review (2 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Close the breakout rooms for review.

- Call the class back to attention.
- Review the deliverables so that students can measure their progress. Those are:
  - Model a daily standup.
  - Build a user flow.
  - Make use of feedback from at least two instructional staff members on their user flow.
  - Sketch paper wireframes for their mobile applications.
  - Build a clickable prototype in InVision, Figma, or Adobe XD Prototype.

> **Instructor Note:** The instructional staff should check in with each group on their progress. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to briefly share an anecdote and life lesson learned from their own design group work. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions, then move on to recap and end the day.

## 8. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)

- Before the next class, students need to complete all of the Day 5 deliverables listed in the [Group Project 1 Requirements document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y/edit#heading=h.6hggydw6dvip).
- Group Project 1 is about practicing their skills and building portfolio-ready presentations and prototypes. Connect what they worked on with the bigger picture. For example:
  - You are through a full 2-week sprint. This is practice for the working world. 
  - Collaborating together on the design process is hard work but capturing your process and building a case study will make your project work valuable in the real world. 

>  :gem: **Designer Insight:** Relate an insight about sketching wireframes with group input from your professional life.

- Next, remind everyone you're staying online for office hours after class.
- Finally, take questions.
- Thank everyone for doing their best work today.
- Good night!
