# 6.2 Lesson Plan: Group Project 1: Day 4

---

## Overview

Today, students will continue working on Group Project 1. They'll work on user flows, wireframes, and low-fidelity prototypes.

You and your teaching assistants (TAs) will guide the student groups through a standup and workshop sessions to help them produce their deliverables.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Model a daily standup.
2. Build a user flow.
3. Make use of feedback from at least two instructional staff members on their user flow.
4. Sketch paper wireframes for their mobile app.
5. Build a low-fidelity clickable paper prototype in InVision, Adobe XD, or Figma.

## Class at a Glance

Today, students will work on paper prototyping and low-fidelity prototyping and testing.

- Today you will hold a standup before the Work Sessions begin.
- There are two Work Sessions. 
- Throughout, workshop with student groups and help them find ways to get unstuck.
- If a group falls behind schedule, assign a TA to workshop with them.  

> **Instructor Note:** Time Management Tip: Make sure each group has a 15-20-minute check-in with a minimum of two instructional staff members before the end of the day. 


> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Ask students to sign up for the 15-20-minute time slots via Slack or Zoom chat.

## Prepare for Class

- **Review your lecture slides:** [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/06.2-Group-Project 1, Day 4 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s0W-ITNpuyJI903A2M_tu91FsYrLM894mfh0ho0WzxE).
- **Review** the [How to Help Students Get Unstuck document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJKtoLw-7bYNvLxRSyUFso64-y0hStQGCOCXp22drPY/edit?usp=sharing) for helpful questions to ask during the working session.
- **The day's objectives are key:** By the end of the day, students should have met most of the day's objectives. 
- **On student anxiety:** Students will often report anxiety around the feedback they receive from the instructional staff. 
    - Ease students' concerns by telling them that each instructor and each person will have a different perspective and this diversity of opinion is a good thing. 
    - Help them appreciate that as UX designers in the workplace, it is our job to take feedback from many stakeholders and use that to mold our solutions.
- **User flows must come to completion:** Students need to come out of today's working session with a user flow so they can build wireframes. Students must set up a time to workshop with at least two of the instructional staff.
- There is a slotted time for the user flow review. Students will likely need to check in throughout the work session.
  
- Set up and Slack out the [User Flow Check-in Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vjm_8BNEoxJIz1RAYGtpPVf8gafrAWbxEjMHeitWe9Q) so students can sign up for review. You can also write it on the whiteboard.
- **Important:** Each student will create their own paper prototype based on their group user flow that will be reviewed by 2 instructional staff.
  - This way, each student gets practice sketching and prototyping. The group then can conduct an A/B test of the paper prototypes to identify the best version to execute for their digital prototype.
- **Helping students get unstuck:** The user flow is an essential component of interaction design. 
    - The user flow is often the most critical component of the user experience for building new applications or auditing existing applications. It is a very challenging deliverable for students to execute on. 
    - We suggest that students receive multiple rounds of feedback on their user flows from different instructors to help mold their point of view.
- **Remember:** Instructors and TAs should not be idle at their computers. You should be engaging with students throughout the entire day.
- At your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.

  - In these workshops, student groups will rotate between the instructor and TAs to get help on specific tasks. These workshops should be between 10 and 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

  - This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom and find small spaces to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

- **Using Zoom:** It takes time to become proficient using Zoom, the primary online instructional tool. Please refer to the following guide for help performing essential online teaching tasks (sharing screens, managing breakout rooms, etc.):
  - [Zoom Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MtogY4tO4aMPgQ0mlHpdtvi8rmkt9efN__mBngs9tg/edit).

- If needed, review [Strategies for Class Online](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/ux-ui-curriculum-version2/tree/master/01-lesson-plans/06-Week#strategies-for-class-online).   

Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Encourage students to log in early and use the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.


---

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Today's Objectives (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to get student groups into working mode and to keep the energy high for making progress. In the real world, the enthusiasm for one's team and the problems you're all solving goes a long way.

### Welcome to class!

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Engage students! Get them into a design mindset. Ask if anyone has come across an interesting design article or any cool industry news. You can share, too!

Launch your slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/06.2-Project 1, Day 4 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s0W-ITNpuyJI903A2M_tu91FsYrLM894mfh0ho0WzxE).

- First, let students know what today holds. Today is all about paper prototyping and low-fidelity prototyping and testing.

**Instructions:**

- Set up and Slack out the [User Flow Check-in Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vjm_8BNEoxJIz1RAYGtpPVf8gafrAWbxEjMHeitWe9Q) so students can sign up for review. Alternatively, write it on the board.

- Next, review today's group goals and requirements for Work Sessions 1 and 2. 
- Finally, review today's objectives.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Briefly share an anecdote about a prototype you worked on as part of a design team.

Next, it's time for the daily standup!  

## 2. Student Do: Daily Standup (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Create breakout rooms for the student groups. One instructional staff member should observe each group. Use the same groups as last class.

- Pay attention to students' "today" tasks. Each group should have ample tasks. 

**Instructions:** 

2. Each group should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.

   - Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

Next, review how the standups went in a quick review—that's your next two minutes!  

## 3. Instructor Do: Standup Review (2 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: TAs can use a breakout room to address blockers. Help groups focus and collaborate on resolving those blockers. 

- **Blockers:** Encourage teams to work through blockers as a team. 
  - There are many UX deliverables team members can be working on. Use your discretion to reorder or reassign deliverables based on individual team dynamics. 
  - When working with teams, the goal is to assist rather than be a taskmaster. What the teams learn today become habits for their design future. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to briefly share what they have learned from doing standups and becoming better at them over time.  

Now it's time for students to dig into today's tasks with a Work Session—which runs an hour!

## 4. Student Do: Work Session 1 (60 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to get student groups into working mode and keep the energy high for making progress.

**Important**: Be sure students can easily refer to the Deliverables. Either leave that slide up on your screen or cut and paste a snapshot of the slide into Slack. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Cut and paste a screenshot of the Deliverables slide and share in Slack.

- Set a timer for 60 min.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Put student groups into Zoom breakout rooms.

- Encourage a lot of sketching. Student groups might want to use the whiteboard.

  - TAs: remind student groups to take photos of their process. Documenting teams' processes can also help you interact with groups.

- With your TAs, visit with each group. Teams should not finish early or look idle. If that is the case, join their group and give feedback on deliverables for iteration.

## 5. Break (15 min)

During a working session day, the break is for the instructional staff. But if working groups do need a
break, they should take one. However, students shouldn't take a break if it interferes with
workshops.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Don't stop sharing your screen! Put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual timer will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

**After break:** students will make further progress on their tasks. Their second Work Session runs one hour and twenty minutes! 

## 6. Student Do: User Flow Checkpoint Review and Work Session 2 (80 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to get student groups to identify what they need to finish by the end of class to keep moving forward.

### Use Flow Review. (~20 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Close the breakout rooms to announce user flow reviews. Call the class back to attention. 

> **Instructor Note:** If you haven't already checked off group user flows, take time to review each group's with your TA quickly.

- Review the deliverables so that students can measure their progress. Those are:  
  - Build a user flow.

> **Instructor Note:** :heavy_check_mark: **User Flow Checkpoint:** An instructor or TA must check and approve students' user flows before they can create wireframes. Specifically, groups must receive feedback from at least two instructional staff members on their user flow by the end of the day. 

### Work Session 2: Paper prototyping/Wireframing

- **Important**: Be sure students can easily refer to the Deliverables. Either leave that slide up on your screen or cut and paste a snapshot of the slide into Slack. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Cut and paste a screenshot of the Deliverables slide and share in Slack.

- Set a timer for 60 min.

**Instructor and TAs:**

During the Work Session, support students by making time to review user flows with students. You and the TAs should rotate among the breakout rooms, giving feedback on the groups' user flows while students work on their projects.  

  - Sketch paper wireframes for their mobile applications.
  - Build a clickable prototype in InVision, Adobe XD Prototype, or Figma.

> **Instructor Note:** As InVision, Figma, or Adobe XD Prototypes get produced, make sure groups are sharing for you to leave comments and give feedback.

## 7. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Close the breakout rooms for the recap. 

- **Recap: Group Project 1 Deliverables and Requirements:** review the list of deliverables so that students can measure their progress.  

- Next, congratulate teams on the progress they have made today. 
  - Reminder: the work doesn't stop because the class is over! Everyone should continue to make progress *as a team* outside of class.
- Let students know what's next: Before the next class, students need to ***complete all of the Day 4 deliverables*** listed in the [Group Project 1 Requirements document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y/edit#heading=h.6hggydw6dvip).

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share an insight about coping with anxiety around the pressure of deadlines and working in groups based on your design experience with teams.

- Next, remind everyone you're staying online for office hours after class.
- Finally, take questions.
- Thank everyone for doing their best work today.
- Good night!
