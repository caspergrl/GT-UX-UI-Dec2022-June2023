## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Practice group project stand-ups.
2. Continue working on their projects.
3. Examine problem definitions.
4. Sketch ideas and work with paper in groups.

## Class at a Glance

## Prepare for Class

- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/22.3 Final Project Day 3 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WQoHOvXaQPkZJC-NZ-n47lN9ThdloboZVd0YB7vGkiE).

- Make a PDF copy of the Google slides to share with students and TAs via Slack. Feel free to modify the slides slightly to fit your style, but be sure to cover the same concepts and activities.

- In today's class, students will continue working on their projects.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [22-24-Final-Project/03-TimeTrackers/22.3-TimeTracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1we8Qe_ftnBusOaqiy8I9BXX1asIpRzAyjjBnc-prLKU/edit?usp=sharing).

- If your class is on a Saturday schedule, use the flex time for extending lectures, activities, or review sessions. 

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Office Hours: (45 mins before class) (Office Hours)

Encourage students to come early and utilize the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Intro to Final Group Project 3, Day 3 (5 min)

- Launch today's slides: [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/22.3 Final Project Day 3 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WQoHOvXaQPkZJC-NZ-n47lN9ThdloboZVd0YB7vGkiE). Feel free to modify the slides slightly to fit your own style, but be sure to cover the same concepts and activities.

  - Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.

- Welcome students to the class, share today's objectives, then have them work on their projects.

  - You and the TAs will offer help, as necessary.

  - Students should be at a rudimentary place for starting user flows, sketches, and some basic HTML/CSS.

  - Suggest deliverables that all team members should have completed: personas, problem statements, user funnels, user journeys, etc.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation**:** Quickly cover that today is a working day and review the progress groups should be hitting. Get your groups into Zoom break out rooms. Leave 1 group in the main room to preserve the Zoom recording for class.

## 2. Student Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation**:** With TAs try using Slack to have group members report their scrum. **Y:** What did I work on yesterday? **T:** What am I working on today? **B:** What issues are blocking me?

**Instructions:**

1. Split the teams up equally among the instructional staff.

2. Each group member should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.

   - Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

## 3. Instructor Do: Daily Scrum Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention and review any common themes you saw with the class.

## 4. Student Do: Working Session 1 (70 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation**:** With TAs rotate between groups mixing in and asking questions. Use Slack to schedule review session times.

- Groups keep working on their projects.

- Instructors/TAs offer help when possible.

---

## 5. Break (15 min on weekdays/45 min on Saturday)

- Say, **"Let's take a break before we get into the next working session."**

> **Instructor Note:** Breaks work a little differently during dedicated working sessions days. The break is more for the instructional staff but if groups need a break just have them take it as long as it doesn't interfere with your workshops.

---

## 6. Student Do: Working Session 2 (60 min)

>  :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation**:** With TAs rotate between groups mixing in and asking questions. Use Slack to schedule review session times.

- Students should continue working on their projects.

## 7. Instructor Do: Review (10 min)

- Review any overarching questions and offer closing thoughts.

## 8. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation**:** Call all groups back from their Zoom break out rooms and cover any questions.

- Say, **"We did a lot today. As a UX/front-end developer, you should be iterating, and your team should be prototyping next week if you're not already!"**
