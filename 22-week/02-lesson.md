# 22.2 Lesson Plan: Final Group Project 3, Day 2

## Overview

In this class, students will continue working on their Final Group Project 3, an HTML/CSS website prototype.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Practice a daily stand-up.
2. Improve on their Final Group Project 3.
3. Define problems and delegate project tasks.

## Class at a Glance

- Students should continue working on their Final Group Project 3.

- Students should be introduced to the concepts of planning a project and building a visual plan.

## Prepare for Class

- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/22.2 Final Project Week 1 Day 2 slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13bDogNeRT3EQDcN-uyskWmcv_4RCinN_pAdYPSxH_Nw).

- Make a PDF copy of the Google slides to share with students and teaching assistants (TAs) via Slack. Feel free to modify the slides slightly to fit your style, but be sure to cover the same concepts and activities.

- In today's class, students will continue working on their projects.

- Instructors: You'll use the **"small group"** workshop format, if possible, to reinforce the concepts of project planning and Gantt charts. This is best done in a "small group" format. More adept groups can concentrate on their projects while you give additional attention to those students who are struggling.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have the TAs consult the [22-24-Final-Project/03-TimeTrackers/22.2 Timetracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ynB9kjk7MfY2nCzvnyyPiI7xTm4TsBoaHhQWkdCrdaM/edit?usp=sharing).

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Intro to Final Group Project 3, Day 2 (5 min)

- Launch today's slides: [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/22.2 Final Project Week 1 Day 2 slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13bDogNeRT3EQDcN-uyskWmcv_4RCinN_pAdYPSxH_Nw).

  - Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.

> **Instructor Note:** Start the class with an engagement tactic to keep working on their final group project with high engagement!

- Share today's objectives.

  - Remind students that they will need to have their one-page proposal from the last class available.

## 2. Instructor Do: Project Management and Gantt Chart Update (5 min)

- Say, **"Your groups all have a direction and are starting to do some research. Let's talk about our projects for the final presentation next week."**

**Project Management.**

- Ask, **"Has anyone completed tasks on their Gantt charts?"**
  - Remind students they'll be repeating the planning process from Project 2, but they'll need to cover more ground than before.
  - Get groups together to review their Gantt charts and discuss their project progress.

## 3. Student Do: Iterate and Update the Project Management Gantt Chart (5 min)

- Students open the Gantt chart from the last class and review it as a team.

- With the TAs, monitor the student groups and help them with their deliverable deadlines and task assignments.

## 4. Student Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Have groups quickly get into the their Zoom break out rooms with the TAs quickly move between each group to do a quick scrum. Keep 1 group in the main room to preserve the Zoom recording.

**Instructions:**

1. Split the teams up equally among the instructional staff.

2. Each group member should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.

   - Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

## 5. Instructor Do: Daily Scrum Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention and review any common themes you saw with the class.

## 6. Student Do: Working Session 1 (60 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: With our TAs use Slack to communicate with your groups and let them know when you will be joining their breakout rooms.

> Instructors note: Begin pulling out small groups of students and walking through their Gantt charts.

- Groups should be working on the tasks defined in today's Gantt as well as looking for deliverables that are connected. A (proto-persona) before B (user persona), etc.

- **TAs:** During this time, work with groups as "one of the team members" in 20-minute sessions per group. Essentially, serve as Senior UX designers floating among teams.

## 7. Break (10 min)

- Say, **"Let's take a break before we get into the next working session."**

    - Seeking feedback from users
    - Testing ideas rapidly
    - Measuring impact
