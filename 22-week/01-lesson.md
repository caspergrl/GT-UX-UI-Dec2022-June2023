# 22.1 Lesson Plan: Final Group Project 3, Day 1

## Overview

In this class, students will begin their Final Group Project 3 of the UX/UI Boot Camp. The final project is an HTML/CSS website prototype powered by design thinking that creatively solves human-centered needs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Review the timeline and deliverable requirements of the Final Group Project Weeks.
2. Brainstorm project ideas.
3. Create a Gantt chart for the Final Group Project 3.
4. Write a project proposal.
5. Obtain instructor approval for project direction.

## Class at a Glance

- Introduce the students to the goals and requirements of Final Group Project 3.

- For project management, student groups should produce a Gantt chart for the project timeline.

- Make sure students take an entire class day to identify a project idea, research the users, and begin the initial work outlining their design.

- Each group should submit a one-page project proposal by the end of the day.

## Prepare for Class and the Final Group Project
- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/22.1 - Final Project 3 Week 1 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TQPjdoytyga2gvg5AgnJhMbUK_b-wJpf9q0iiSnAqCI/edit?usp=sharing).
- As the instructor and TAs, keep in mind that the success of your students after boot camp is largely dictated by the quality of the projects in their portfolios. Encourage your students to do their best work and steer them toward producing high-quality final projects!

### Final Group Project Schedule

- The schedule for the Final Group Project 3 follows:

  - Day 1 (today):

    - Students are introduced to the goals and requirements of the Final Group Project 3 Weeks.
    - Students design a Final Group Project 3 Gantt Sheet to manage their teams' time.
    - Students work with the instructor and TAs to brainstorm and identify feasible projects.
    - Students submit a project proposal.

  - Day 2:

    - Students are given all of the class to work on their projects.
    - The instructor and TAs work closely with groups to offer "UX/human-need assistance."

  - Day 3:

    - Students are given all of the class to work on their projects.

  - Day 4 (next week):

    - Students are given all of the class to work on their projects.
    - The instructor and TAs work closely with groups to offer "UX/human-need assistance."

  - Day 5:

    - Students are given all of the class to work on their projects.

  - Day 6:

    - Students are given all of the class to work on their projects.

  - Day 7 (final week):

    - Students work on their projects.
    - Students begin planning their final presentations.

  - Day 8 (Presentations 1):

    - Students present their final projects!

  - Day 9 (Presentations 2 and Graduation):

    - Students present their final projects and graduate!

    - Allot time in the end on the final day for congratulations, photos, and goodbyes.
- At your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.
- In these workshops, student groups will rotate among the instructor and TAs for help on specific topics, such as refining ideas, finding the user need, ideating (e.g., what if/I like/I wish), empathizing with users (e.g., proto-personas), and so forth.
  - These workshops should be 10 to 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.
    - This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom to a small space to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

### Help students avoid scope creep

Students have been down this road twice now. Still, you continue to play a critical role in helping students to get focused, stay focused, and manage their project scope.

Without your help, many students will take an unfocused approach to their projects and give weak presentations. Help them keep their focus narrow. While three weeks is not enough time to solve the world hunger problem, it’s enough time to help improve a particular food donation flow.

Continue to work with the TAs to evaluate student groups' goals and make recommendations for limiting the scope of their projects throughout the three weeks.

>  Instructor Note: If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Have your TAs reference the [22-24-Final-Project/03-Time Trackers/22.1-TimeTracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ozBVDBALvPr0o1N89kcHTfsLfkdHQwF6BNsBmazJiA8/edit?usp=sharing) to help keep track of time during class.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Encourage students to come early and use the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Intro to Final Group Project 3, Day 1 (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to kick off the Final Group Project 3 with a bang. This project is the students' last group work of the boot camp and an opportunity to show off all the skills they have acquired!

> **Instructor Note:** Start the class with an engagement tactic to keep the energy high and the enthusiasm for the final group project strong.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Share your screen and change your Zoom background to a launch scene, celebration, or other kick off background.

- Launch today's slides: [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/22.1 - Final Project 3 Week 1 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TQPjdoytyga2gvg5AgnJhMbUK_b-wJpf9q0iiSnAqCI/edit?usp=sharing).

- Use Slide 14 (“Workshop = Productivity + Collaboration”) as a cue to assign students into teams.

### **Tuckman’s Team Development Stages** 

Review the 5 stages of team development for a 3rd time. 

- **Forming:** The team has just been introduced and everyone is overly polite and pleasant. At the start, most are excited to start something new and to get to know the other team members.

> **Instructor Note:** Today/this week may represent this stage

- **Storming:** The reality and weight of completing the task at hand have now hit everyone.  Personalities may clash. Members might disagree over how to complete a task or voice their concerns if they feel that someone isn’t pulling their weight. Remember that most teams experience conflict.

> **Instructor Note:** This week/next week will likely pass through this stage. Work with you TAs to identify groups in the storming stage early and help resolve conflicts to keep group projects moving forward.

- **Norming:** During the norming stage, people start to notice and appreciate their team members’ strengths. Groups start to settle into a groove. Everyone is contributing and working as a cohesive unit.

> **Instructor Note:** This week/next week will likely pass into this stage. Do your best to get teams into the norming stage as quickly as possible. Groups will like get to this position during the group project. H

- **Performing:** Groups are more confident, motivated, and familiar enough with the project and their team that they can operate without supervision. Everyone is on the same page and driving full-speed ahead towards the final goal..

> **Instructor Note:** By week three some groups will likely pass into this stage. Do your best to keep pushing team to perform all the way to the presentations.

- **Adjourning:**

- Once a project ends, the team disbands. This phase is sometimes known as mourning because members have grown close and feel a loss now that the experience is over.

> **Instructor Note:** During the final group project some students will have accomplished a log and may feel emotional about "breaking up the band". These emotions should be recognized and encourage group to capture their feeling and pour them into their UX/UI case studies for their portfolios. Teams looking to hire UX/UI designers want to see how they work on a team. 

### **One page proposal.**

- Remind the students that they'll need to turn in a one-page proposal to instructors by the end of the day. They can just Slack out the proposal file to you. (You do not need to keep it for official purposes, but you will need it to review their final plans for feasibility.)

**TAs** to Slack out the [22-24-Final-Project/02-Activities/22.1-Final Group Project 3 Requirements Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qS-y0hHAejaFFWIJILpiZ73m0mgz3Y3Y-ahaYYG3j6E/edit#).

- Remind students that they have done this before, but now they're expected to go even further.

  - Students should really push each other and build portfolio-worthy projects that will help them land new jobs.

- Share samples of a student work.

- Review the workshop method.

  - Class time is designed to be highly productive. The instructional staff is here to give student teams feedback. Students should make good use of this opportunity.

- Review the three-week plan.

- Remind student team members to be good coworkers.

- Review today's objectives.

- Before moving on, make sure all students are in teams of two or three and are sitting in their groups.

### Discuss Scope Creep

> 🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Invite students to use Zoom chat or Slack to share lessons learned from Group Projects One and Two regarding scope creep. 

One of the biggest challenges students will face during their projects is avoiding scope creep. The key is to keep the focus of your project narrow from the start. Once you have a narrow focus, it's important to keep that focus from widening and growing out of scope during the next three weeks. 

Scope creep isn't just a student issue, designers struggle with it, too. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Bring the importance of scope creep to life by sharing an anecdote from your own work—did a project grow so far out of scope that nothing was accomplished? Alternatively, what about a time that a project's scope so narrowly focused that its outcome was definite and truly successful?
>
> - Invite a TA to share as well. 

Take questions, then move on. 

## 2. Instructor Do: Working Session 1 and Brainstorming/Ideation (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Quickly get groups into Zoom breakout rooms and assign TAs to groups to rotate between. Keep 1 group in the main room to preserve the zoom recording to the class session.

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to get groups working on their tasks. As it is their third group project, students should be familiar with what is expected of them and ready to work with teams.

> **Instructor Note:** Activities like brainstorming are only suggestions; work with groups in whatever way the instructional team sees fit.

- Today, at your discretion, you and the TAs can implement a workshop series with individual groups. In these workshops, student groups will rotate among you and the TAs for help on specific topics. Recommend the groups start with brainstorming to choose a cause or idea space.

- Review how ideation and coming up with ideas is sometimes the first step for any project.

  - Understanding "what is?" can help us push for "what if?" and "what wows!" We can then prototype something "that works."

  - The best ideas are driven by some user insight.

  - If you don't know who your user is, what they need, and what pain points they have with the "way it is," it will be hard to think about ideas for what you want to solve.

  - Remind students: **"Your groups need a direction by the end of today. You have the rest of the week to find or define your problem more concretely."**

- Review brainstorming rules.

  - Read off every rule.

1. Start with a problem statement.
2. Encourage wild ideas and defer judgment!
3. Build on the ideas of others.
4. Stay focused on a topic.
5. All ideas should be heard.
6. Be visual. Draw your ideas.
7. Go for quantity.

![Ideation-start](images/Lots-of-Stickynotes.jpeg)

> Soapbox: Brainstorming is about coming up with numerous ideas, not just one! As a team, you have multiple minds. See if you can elevate each other's initial ideas and inclinations.

## 3. Instructor Do: Brainstorming: "I Like, I Wish, and What If" Method (5 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Have students use Miro or Fimga and share their collaborative space in Slack.

Describe how the **"I Like, I Wish, and What If"** method works, covered in Unit 2:

- This is a simple and extremely useful method to structure feedback and can be used by teams of two or as many as 100 people.
- "I like" statements convey positive feedback.
  - Example: I like that Airbnb shows me reviews based off of communication.
- "I wish" statements convey negative feedback. Saying "I wish" is more favorable than saying "I don't like."
  - Example: I wish that Airbnb could show you a virtual tour.
- "What if" statements talk about the distant future. This method creates positive communication because it reframes statements from something negative to something positive.
  - Example: What if Airbnb had a chat client so I could easily talk to hosts?
- Feedback is best given with "I" statements.
  - Example: “I sometimes feel you don’t listen to me” instead of “You don’t listen to a word I say.”

## 4. Student Do: Brainstorming: "I Like, I Wish, and What If" Activity (20 min)

![Ideation-start](images/WI-IL-IW-exercise.jpg)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Work with your TAs to move between Zoom breakout rooms to help teams ideate.

**Instructions:**

1. Students get into groups and take out materials.

2. Students write "I like, I wish, and what if" statements on sticky notes.

3. Students place their sticky notes on the board or a large piece of paper. Students group and combine ideas on the board or their paper.

- Students begin working with groups to identify ideas, research users, and create project designs.

- Monitor student groups and make sure they're generating ideas.

- At your discretion, begin hosting "workshops" to help steer groups in the right direction.

  - Spend extra time with groups that are struggling. Ask them about their users. What do they need? What problem do they want to solve?

  - TAs should make sure group members are doing equal work.

## 5. Student Do: Brainstorming: Review, Combine, and Vote (10 min)

- Hopefully, the **"I like, I wish, and what if"** exercise has generated many ideas.

- Combine categories and look for similarities and patterns.

**Instructions:**

1. As a group, take the three sticky note colors and look for some categories.

   - Categories might include apps, features, needs, and design.

2. As a group, take the sticky notes and combine them into idea clusters.

3. As a group, vote for two ideas that are on the list.

- With the TAs, monitor the groups and help them create idea categories based on their list of ideas.

  - If a group is struggling to see patterns, spend more time with that group and their items.

- Help student groups with voting. Ask them for criteria of why they voted for one idea over another.

## 6. Instructor Do: Project Management and Gantt Charts (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to have students expand their project management skills as a team and visualize what they want to accomplish over time.

- Say, **"Your groups are starting to do some research. Let's talk about our project planning."**

- Project management is about monitoring and controlling a process. At this point, every team is versed in the design thinking process and should be able to apply it to their team.

- Gantt charts for project management:

  - Ask, **"Has anyone ever used Gantt charts?"**

  - Remind students they'll repeat the planning process from Group Project 2, but they'll need to cover more ground this time.

- Review the pros and cons of Gantt charts for project management.

  Pros:
  - Breaks the project into time-based tasks by person
  - Shows the relationships and contingencies
  - Is good for a high-level view

  Cons:
  - Is hard to represent agile (simultaneous actions)
  - Is difficult to foresee the future
  - Can get complicated quickly

- Agile Design and Development Sprints in a Gantt.

The agile approach includes assembling the project’s requirements and using them to define the project. Teams (Design and Dev) then plan the necessary sprints, and divide each sprint into its own list of requirements.

- Project management software:

  - There are many options for project management software. The volume alone indicates that no one has cracked the code for planning and managing work.

## 7. Student Do: Gantt Chart Activity (15 min)

Instructions:

- Set up and Slack out the [22-24-Final-Project/02-Activities/22.1-02-Final Project 3 Gantt Chart Activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_lusJ8g5BbBnfPu3q3sbu5ie9ZVrEoiGFMpF6dxyNA/edit?usp=sharing).

- Student groups plan out their Final Group Project 3.

  - Represent the time as bars and distribute tasks from the project requirement doc.

  - Use color for each group member.

  - Establish user tasks and project deliverables to time.

- With the TAs, monitor each group to help with deliverable deadlines and assigning tasks.

## 8. Instructor Do: Gantt Chart Review (5 min)

The TAs will work with the groups to focus and collaborate on tasks that are blocking team members.

- Encourage teams to work through blockers together.
- Use your discretion to reorder or reassign deliverables based on individual team dynamics.
- When working with teams, the goal is not to be a task master but to assist teams in solving workload issues together.

![Break-start](images/Break-Time.jpg)

## 9. Break (10 min on weekdays/45 min Saturday)

- Say, **"Let's take a break before we get into the next working session."**

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Don't stop sharing your screen during the break. Instead, display a Google timer or YouTube timer video on your screen. That will help get students back into the Zoom room on time.

---

## 10. Student Do: Working Session 2 and Brainstorming (60 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Quickly get groups back into Zoom breakout rooms and assign TAs to groups to rotate between. Keep 1 group in the main room to preserve the zoom recording to the class session.

- In Working Session 2, student groups continue working to identify ideas, research users, and create project designs. The groups will rotate among you and the TAs for help on specific topics.

## 11. Instructor Do: Final Group Project 3 Proposal (10 min)

![Elevator-Pitch-start](images/elevator-pitch.png)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Give a 1 minute warning and then Return all groups back to the main Zoom room to discuss the project proposal.

Ask TAs to Slack out the [22-24-Final-Project/02-Activities/22.1-03-Project Proposal Instructions Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TieLrmuQTvpW334lRt8ktQyIT9FckLgSbdCBP7vKgD4/edit#heading=h.wktpqu7411m9).

- Make sure student groups are preparing a one-page project proposal.

- Review any overarching questions and offer closing thoughts.

  - Tell students to use Google Docs to collaborate on their project proposal.

- The project proposals should include:

  - Project title
  - Team members
  - Project description
  - User description (proto-persona)
  - User focus
  - Rough breakdown of tasks

- Walk around to each group and check in on their one-page project proposals.

  - Assist and approve project proposals.

## 12. Student Do: Pitch a Project (30 min)

![Pitch-start](images/pitch-a-brilliant-idea.jpg)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Quickly get groups back into Zoom breakout rooms and assign TAs to groups to rotate between. Keep 1 group in the main room to preserve the zoom recording to the class session.

- Students will discuss their one-page proposal with the instructional staff. When ready, they'll pitch their idea to the instructor for approval to keep moving forward.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Give a 1 minute warning and then Return all groups back to the main Zoom room to quick pitch their projects as groups.

## 13. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (2 min)

- Say, **"You all have great starting places for your projects. Keep collaborating and researching in your groups."**

- Empathy and insights are key to your group, so keep practicing.

  - Ask, **"Any questions?"**

- Wish everyone a good night.
