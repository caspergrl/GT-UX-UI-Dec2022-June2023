# 17.1 Lesson Plan: Introduction to HTML and CSS

------

## Overview

Welcome to the front-end development segment of the boot camp!

Today, you'll introduce students to **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** and **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**, the foundation for advanced work. Understanding HTML and CSS gives students a language for communicating with front-end web developers and also prepares them to create basic webpages.

**The Next Five Weeks**

For the next five weeks, you'll help students learn and practice key aspects of front-end web development, culminating in students completing their design portfolios.

- Week 17: HTML and CSS (this week)
- Week 18: Advanced HTML and CSS
- Week 19: JavaScript/jQuery
- Week 20: Bootstrap 4 and JavaScript/jQuery
- Week 21: Web Prototyping

**You're teaching students to become code conversational.**

For the remainder of the UX/UI Boot Camp, students will be learning the basics of front-end development. Your aim is to help the students become familiar with the medium in which their solutions ultimately will live: code!

The goal is to make students "code conversational" and allow them to experiment and understand the limits of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when it comes to building prototypes. While we do not expect students to become full-fledged developers by the end of the boot camp, we do want to make students competitive in the job market. Being code-conversational will help students become better teammates and more prepared to work alongside their developer counterparts when they leave the boot camp.

You'll use developer tools such as GitHub and GitHub Desktop, Visual Studio Code, CodePen.io, Chrome Inspect, and others. Your own confidence in using the tools will help translate to your students. ***Preparation and practice will help you give demos effectively and boost your confidence as an instructor guiding students through learning to code.***

Not a seasoned developer? That's OK!

Be honest with your students and let them know that "coding" is not your day-to-day job and that everyone will learn from each other. Do take time to prepare for the coding lessons, and lean on your teaching assistants (TAs) if they have more experience with code concepts or helping struggling students.

Read and share with your students:

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Create a project folder structure with one main folder to hold web development projects.
2. Learn and practice writing HTML tags.
3. Code a link tag to make a connection between the current HTML document and an external CSS resource.
4. Learn to select basic HTML tags in CSS and add color, typography styles, and background images.

## Class at a Glance

Today's class is about HTML and CSS. It is divided into two parts:

- Part 1 introduces HTML.
- Part 2 introduces CSS.

---


## Preparing for Today's Class

**Review the slides beforehand**.

- [17-Week/01-Slides/17.1 Intro to HTML & CSS Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r-hmwppxe6a1Zq_2mDAnyy_CZFBAaKB4wN66nPilWJw/edit?usp=sharing). 

**Pull down today's working files.**

Students will need the working files during the activities in the code section. Find the files in the UX/UI repository under each day's activity folder.

***Before class, confirm you can pull from the repository so you can share the working files with students.***

Students will use these working files in tandem with Google Docs instructions to complete activities.

**Prepare for today's demos.**

Today, you'll present three five-minute demonstrations of basic tasks, such as using a text editor and writing CSS selectors. You will also present a mini-demo of the anatomy of a webpage within your lecture about HTML.

Be sure to practice the demos at least twice before class.

- Section 2 demonstrates the anatomy of a webpage (within the HMTL lecture).
- Section 10 demonstrates link tags and empty elements.
- Section 12 demonstrates CSS selectors.
- Section 16 demonstrates fonts on the web.


- Reinforce consistent file structure with students for all activities to avoid issues down the road.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

---

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have the TAs consult the [17-Week/03-Time Trackers/17.1 Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/162t7cvWuX09pD7V7p6IwDCnzLA4yAu7w-5F5SAiEduM/edit?usp=sharing).

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

---


## Preparing to Teach Weeks 17-21

**Help students program.**

- Many students will be nervous about getting into programming. Some might even have impostor syndrome. Reassure students that these feelings are normal and will pass. After all, they're learning a new language.

  - Be sure to mention that the best way to feel more comfortable working with code is to *code*! Every coder working today had to begin somewhere. Your students are no different today than coders were when they started. Practice makes perfect; the best way to get rid of impostor syndrome is to practice.

**Share anecdotes about your journey.**

- Don't be afraid to talk about the difficulties you experienced when you first started learning how to program. Knowing that you also struggled will help students feel better about not completely understanding the material yet.

**Encourage pair coding.**

While the in-class activities indicate that students should work independently, encourage students to work together on problems.

- As pair programming is a common agile software development technique, it is relevant for them to at least try it out for themselves.

- If you decide to pair students to program together in your class, try to pair weaker students with stronger ones.

**Download key tools.**

- If you don't already have them, be sure you have the following tools on your computer:
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

**Set up your computer.**

- ***Design a setup for teaching that works for you:***
  - During the coding portion of the lecture, some instructors choose to mirror their laptop screen for the projector so that students can watch them code.

  - Other instructors have used different methods to help them facilitate coding, such as an additional laptop, iPad, or iPhone to review the materials during the lecture.

- ***Adjust your Visual Studio Code settings:***

- Students need to be able to see the code you display. Make sure that you enlarge the text on your text editor so that the students can see it clearly.

- ***Enlarge the text on your screen:***
  - In Visual Studio Code, the best way to accomplish this is with **command and +** for Mac, and **shift and +** for Windows. For reducing the size, the hotkeys are **command and -** (iOS) or **Shift and -** (Windows).
  - Set your font size to 24 pixels:
    - This setting is under **Code > Preferences > Settings > Commonly Used > Editor**. For Font Size, choose 24.
  ![Font Size VS Code](Images/font_size.png)

- **Change to a white-colored theme:**

  - You can find these settings under **Code > Preferences > Settings > Search for Theme > WorkBench.** For Color Theme, choose Default Light+.
  ![VS Code Themes](Images/VsCode_Themes.png)

**BEFORE EACH CLASS: Students must now download a .zip file before each class.**

During this front-end development portion of the boot camp, students will use HTML and other file types during their in-class activities. For this reason, students need to download the .zip file in the Activities folder ***before each class***.

> Please upload only the **unsolved.zip** file to your students' Google Drive and pass out the solved files at your discretion. However, if you think it will benefit your class, you may share solved files with the unsolved files.

**Note:** Here is a screenshot of your class files located in your class's Google Drive. Notice both the solved and unsolved files.

![Google Drive Activity Files](Images/solved_unsolved.png)

**Have students create a folder to contain their activity files**:

![Create an Activity folder](Images/createActivity.gif)

**Have students add their unsolved files into the folder structure, so that they don't get lost**:

![Move files](Images/moveFiles.jpg)

---


## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Encourage students to come early, use the time provided, and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Introduce Class Objectives and Setting Expectations (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Our goal is threefold: provide a context for the remaining weeks, introduce new activities workflow, and let students know what to expect as they get into coding.

- Open today's lecture slides [17-Week/01-Slides/17.1 Intro to HTML & CSS Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r-hmwppxe6a1Zq_2mDAnyy_CZFBAaKB4wN66nPilWJw/edit?usp=sharing).

Now that we have one weeks' worth of portfolio work to set out our foundation, let's get into Front-End Dev. 

- In the first two weeks, we'll focus on the basics of web development. We'll discuss HTML, CSS, and what makes these technologies work. We'll cover the standard and flexible box models and how to align content and containers properly.

- In the next two weeks, we'll discuss Bootstrap 4, content developer networks (CDNs), and how to customize these technologies.

- In the last two weeks, we'll introduce students to web tools and web analytic technology like heat mapping and Google Analytics. Afterward, we'll have students work on their portfolios so they're job-ready at graduation.

Here you'll provide context for where students have been, then walk them through how to think about the front-end development portion of the boot camp.

> **Instructor Note:** Be prepared to address questions as you work through this section—this is all new and overwhelming for many students.

### Welcome to Weeks 17-24

Let's recap what we learned over the past 16 weeks of the course and how it relates to what we're learning now.

**During weeks 1-7, we learned about the value of design thinking and how UX designers approach solving problems.**

- We learned how UX professionals research their users to gather insights and evidence that support the digital idea, product, or service they're designing.

- Using these insights, we learned how to create prototypes that showcase our new or redesigned features.

- We created a wireframe for a mobile travel app prototype. First, we researched our assumptions about our users and then used their insights to create a product that is both useful and functional.

**During weeks 8-15, we learned how to build and add visual design to our prototypes.**

- We crafted sleek designs by applying Gestalt principles of visual design and learned how to design on a grid to create a fluid and responsive layout.

- We interviewed users before we tested our assumptions about the viability of our product or idea. We then tested our designs by continuing to prototype and test our full-color prototype iterations.

- To cap off this section, we applied everything we learned in all 15 weeks to a responsive UI redesign of a government agency website. To support our design decisions, we created assets such as a style guide and a wireframe. These assets utilized insights gleaned from user research with a full-color responsive design.

**Now, in weeks 17-21, we are jumping into the front-end development portion of this curriculum.**

- Focusing on how to bring our designs to life on the web and learn to build UI elements and layouts with HTML and CSS structure.

- We are adding animations and interactivity to our website using jQuery to breathe life into our user interfaces.

- We are analyzing our digital products by using Google Analytics and Hotjar to track our users' interactions with websites.

During the remaining weeks of the UX/UI Boot Camp, you will create your own digital portfolios and publish them on the web for all to see. This is an important step toward job interview readiness because it gives you a way to share your work with hiring managers.

After the web portion is finished, we'll conclude this boot camp globally with a project that encompasses all three aspects of the course:

1. Researching, testing, and prototyping
2. Designing full-color responsive designs
3. Coding our work and presenting our findings in a case study

**Jeff Dickey Quote**

_Review software engineer Jeff Dickey's quote. Consider asking a couple of students to read the quote aloud._

## SLIDE 17
With coding, you'll face 3 primary challenges

## SLIDE 18

**The Path of Learning**

There are three obstacles when it comes to learning front-end development:

Obstacle No. 1: *The Great Confusion:*

- When learning front-end development (or any programming language), you will often find yourself with code that works, and you are not sure why.

- When learning any programming language, there is a lot of experimentation or “playing” with code. Naturally, experimenting with something new can cause frustration and confusion if you don’t understand why something is happening. Not knowing why a piece of tech doesn’t work leads to research, which will help you solve the problem.

**Running Into Issues: Researching Solutions to Problems is Par for the Course**

The best developers are really good problem-solvers, motivated by figuring out how websites work and getting to the bottom of problems when they arise. The secret the best developers know is remembering to take a step back from their work to research solutions in order to solve unique problems.

Problem-solving is a normal process that all developers go through. Developers often have to design custom solutions to fit a business's needs.

Understanding the process of problem-solving is just as valuable as finding the solution. While students solve problems, they will learn the valuable workflow and research skills that will make them excellent front-end developers.

## SLIDE 19
Obstacle No. 2: *The Great Doubt:*

- Doubt during the development section is so common that there is a term for it, imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome is when you don't think you have the skills to learn web development (or anything really). The best way to get rid of this feeling is to code! Boost that confidence!

## SLIDE 20
Obstacle No. 3: *The Great Distance:*

- Learning to be a developer takes a long time. Developers never stop learning and are continually adding to what they know. Software changes often, so you will need to keep learning in order to stay relevant!

## SLIDE 21
**Nothing Comes Easy**

You must be persistent and maintain self-confidence if you want to learn to code. Coding is hard work, but you can do it.

## SLIDE 22
**Pair Coding**

Trying to code alone is often a frustrating experience. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to about what you're programming conceptually. When you work with another student, the pair can often reason through code together.

- Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

### What is HTML?

- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
- Hypertext is text that contains links to other text.
- A markup language, unlike a programming language, is only for structuring documents.

> :key: In 1990, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee created HTML to allow non-programmers to publish and share academic documents.

## SLIDE 26
**HTML documents use tags to tell the browser how to format or display the content**  

**HTML is the standard markup language for building webpages.** Frontend developers also use other languages, like CSS and JavaScript, to control how a webpage looks and feels.

**HTML elements are instructions for how to structure content.** The content on a webpage is split into HTML elements, which tell the browser what to do with that content.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Having a basic understanding of HTML is the very first step to being a successful UI developer, because HTML is the foundation for all web pages. Even designers who don't code in the workplace will have to be equipped to talk about HTML.

## SLIDE 27
Nesting is a key part of writing HTML that will work across all browsers, render all content, 
be readable by screen readers, and be able to be targeted by CSS and JavaScript. This readability is one of the advantages of using nesting in HTML.

The basic page structure we outlined before is valid HTML because each element's open tag has a closing tag and fully contains any other elements within it.

## SLIDE 30
Review HTML document structure

## SLIDE 31
All HTML pages have consistent structure: 
The ``<!DOCTYPE html>`` declaration defines this document to be HTML5.  
The ``<html>`` element is the root element of an HTML page.  
The ``<head>`` element contains meta information about the document.  
The ``<title>`` element specifies a title for the document.  
The ``<body>`` element contains the visible page content.

## SLIDE 33
### Anatomy of an HTML Element

Reference the following `a` element and cover all of its parts (tags, attributes, and content).

```html
<a href="usps.com">USPS Site</a>
```

This HTML element represents a clickable link to the USPS website.

1. An HTML element has an **opening tag** and **closing tag**. The letter `a` appears in both, because this is an `a` element. Writing something other than `a` would change the type of element.

	> :key: **Key Tech Note:** There is something inside the opening tag and something between the two tags. Each part works only in a specific location, relative to the tags.

1. Most elements have **attributes**, which live inside the opening tag. These change details or behaviors of the element. The attribute shown here is a hypertext reference, or `href`. Recall that hypertext means text with links to other text; this anchor element links to another document: the USPS website.

	We will talk more later about how each different element type needs specific attributes to work properly.

1. Between the tags is this element's **content**. We say the content is **inside** the element. Content can be simple text, as shown in this anchor element, or it can be more HTML elements.

	Placing HTML elements inside of HTML elements is called **nesting**, because one is nested inside the other.

## SLIDE 34
Review

## SLIDE 35
Debugging is the process of finding and resolving problems within code, similar to editing a paper for spelling and grammar mistakes.

Front-end development work is an iterative process. Writing code perfectly the first time is not likely, even with professionals. Learning to debug is as important as learning to write code.

The process of debugging varies from language to language, but usually starts when you notice something isn't working as intended. In HTML, this means things aren't displaying correctly or are entirely missing.

## SLIDE 36
Review

## SLIDE 37
When characters are missing or misplaced, the resulting bug is a **syntax error**, akin to a spelling or grammar mistake.

## 3. Instructor Do: Element Anatomy on CodePen Demo (5 min)

Demonstrate the use of CodePen and reiterate the anatomy of an element by creating a small example like [this](https://codepen.io/2u-uxuxi-bootcamp/pen/XWMNGwL).

1. Open Chrome and navigate to [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).

1. Start a new project (or "pen") by selecting <kbd>Pen</kbd> from the left-hand menu.

1. Point out that the panels are titled based on the kind of code you can write in each. Because we have only talked about HTML thus far, that is the only panel we will need.

1. Create an anchor element in the HTML panel. Add the parts in the same order as they were introduced in the previous section.

	1. Add opening and closing tags.

	1. Add an `href` attribute inside the opening tag.

		> **Instructor Note:** Make this demo more engaging by asking for URL suggestions from the class.

	1. Add content to match the `href`.

	You should be showing something like this:
	
	![test](images/2020-09-07_codePenDemo.png)

	> **Instructor Note:** Many websites do not allow embedding, and will therefore show a "refused to connect" error in CodePen. Make sure that students know this is just a quirk of working in CodePen.
	>
	> It is still possible to follow the link by right-clicking and selecting <kbd>Open link in new tab</kbd>.

1. Share your code.
	
	1. Select <kbd>Save</kbd> from the top-right menu to make the pen permanent.
	
	1. Select <kbd>Share</kbd>><kbd>Copy Link</kbd> from the bottom-right menu (which will not appear until the pen is saved).

	1. Share the link by pasting it into Slack.

> **Instructor Note:** Before introducing the next activity, pause to answer any questions.

## SLIDE 39
## 4. Student Do: Hello, World! Activity (15 min)

**TAs:** Slack out the activity file: [17.1-01-Hello-World](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16nQVi5UwQCoiMVsggKeSUWVo840PnPEMetDFA4Mr5mg/edit?usp=sharing). 

### Summary

Students will use CodePen to create a traditional "Hello, World!" message in HTML.

### Instructions

Students will start a new pen on CodePen, type the provided HTML structure into their new pen, and share the pen.

_If students struggle:_ Reference the demo from the previous section. Guide students through each step.

_If students complete the activity early:_ Ask if they have any questions about front-end development. Alternatively, you can share [this article](https://uxdesign.cc/should-ux-desingers-learn-to-code-an-ex-developers-perspective-5f6cf04eafc2) on why UX/UI designers need to know code.

### Instructor and TAs

Monitor students and offer to help those who are struggling. Consider doing a quick demo if necessary.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Students should share their screens while working through this activity, so that TAs can monitor their work and provide support.

### Deliverable

Students should submit a link to a pen containing the following code:

```html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hello, World!</a>
```

## SLIDE 40
## 5. Instructor Do: Hello, World! Activity Review (5 min)

Call attention back to the class to lead a discussion of the students' first coding activity. This review provides moral support and encourages a fun, open-minded spirit for coding.

> **Ask:**

- "How did it go?"

- "Was it as hard as you thought?"

- "What was most challenging for you?"

- "What surprised you?"

- "Ready to do it again and again?"

> Instructor Notes:
>
> - Pause for questions. Use the 30-second trick: pause for 30 seconds after asking if there are any questions—invariably, someone raises a hand!
>
> - If students have questions about the basic parts of an element, refer again to the "Anatomy of an HTML Element" slide.

Share some common misconceptions about working with HTML elements:

- "Elements and tags are the same thing."

	_Although many people use these terms interchangeably in casual conversation, there is a difference: "tag" refers only to the code enclosed by angle brackets, whereas "element" refers to the webpage object created by HTML code._

- "Elements must be written on one line."

	_HTML elements are valid with any amount of whitespace between their parts. Different organizations and individuals have different preferences. The most important thing is to be consistent in your own code._


## SLIDE 41
Review

## SLIDE 42
### Semantics Builds on Syntax

There is more to good code than running without errors; there are tiers of correctness:

- Code is **snytactically correct** if it runs without errors. Recall the syntax error caused by omitting a `/` in the closing tag.

- Code is **semantically correct** if it is human-readable. Properly semantic HTML uses each element only for its intended purpose.

## SLIDE 43
Review

## SLIDE 44
### Semantic Elements Have Unique Roles

For example, the `a` tag defines an anchor, or hyperlink. While it is technically possible to use an anchor to simply display content, its intended purpose is to link between pages. To fulfill that role, an anchor requires an `href` attribute.

When making a link between pages, only the anchor element should be used. For simply displaying text, a paragraph element is a better fit.

**Each type of element has a specific role and requires specific attributes to fulfill that role.**

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:**:** Working with other developers means reading other people's code. Your coworkers will appreciate your adherence to semantics, because your HTML will be easier to read.

> :key: **Key Tech Note:** Uniquely in HTML, following semantics goes further than code readability. Using each element exclusively for its intended purpose makes your site more accessible for people who use screen readers and other accessibility features.

Again, every element has a **role** and a set of **required attributes**. For an image element, the role is to display an image, and the single required attribute is the `src` (short for source).


## SLIDE 45
### Optional Attributes

Most elements have optional attributes. For example, an image element can make use of the `alt` attribute to include a textual description of the image. "Alt text" appears if the image doesn't load, and is spoken aloud on screen readers.

The image element also accepts attributes to control its size, like `height` and `width`. We'll explore these in the next activity.


## SLIDE 46
### Exceptions

> **Ask:** "Who noticed that there is no closing tag in this image element?"

In this case, omitting the closing tag isn't a syntax error. Some elements (known as "void elements tags") cannot contain any content. This means we cannot write text inside an image or use nesting to place other HTML elements inside of it.

Some elements are exceptions to the basic rules we have learned about HTML.

> **Ask:** "Between element types, attributes, and exceptions, how do you think frontend developers remember everything?"

## SLIDES 47-48
### Using the Documentation

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:**:** Professional programmers do not have every element and attribute memorized. Frontend developers in the workplace need to be resourceful enough to find answers on their own.

Information about code is called **documentation**. Referencing documentation is a necessary part of writing code.

The most reliable documentation for HTML is W3C, an organization directed by the creator of HTML, Tim Berners-Lee.

## SLIDE 49
Review

## SLIDE 50
## 7. Instructor DO: Using the Documentation Demo (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** **Your goal is to** prepare students for using the documentation. Show them how to work efficiently by keeping CodePen and W3C open side-by-side.

1. Start from an empty desktop.

1. Open Chrome and start a new pen on CodePen.

1. Add the tags of an anchor element, leaving out any attributes or content. Pretend we don't know anything else about how to construct this element.

	```html
	<a></a>
	```

	> **Instructor Note:** Don't act like you actually don't know how to create an anchor element. Make sure the students know that this is a training scenario.

1. Open a second Chrome window and navigate to Google.

	Reposition the windows such that each occupies half of the screen. You should be showing something like this:

	![VS Code and Chrome side-by-side](images/UXI-1431-sideBySide.png)

	> **Instructor Note:** This side-by-side layout can be achieved quickly by using [Mac's Split View](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948) or [Windows' Snap](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027324/windows-10-snap-your-windows).

1. Google `w3c anchor`. Click on the first link, which should be [HTML a tag - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp).

	Scroll through the W3C documentation, making special note of:

	- the "Example" section and <kbd>Try it Yourself »</kbd> button
	- the "Definition and Usage" section, which describes this element's unique role
	- the "Attributes" section and how each attribute has its own article

> **Instructor Note:** Before introducing the next activity, pause to answer any questions.

## SLIDE 51
## 8. Student Do: Semantic Sandbox Activity (15 min)

**TAs:** Slack out the activity file: [17.1-02-Semantic-Sandbox](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eB1uFkK3z34uVUAZjJCAT6qxloAfqOmK_CvUgtL8r00/edit?usp=sharing). 

### Summary

Students will experiment with semantic elements and practice using documentation.

### Instructions

Students will organize their screens to show both CodePen and Google. They will add three elements with the help of W3C and then explore any other two elements that they find interesting.

_If students struggle:_ Reference the [demo](#Instructor-Demonstration-Using-the-Documentation) from the previous section. Guide students through each step.

_If students complete the activity early:_ Encourage students to try as many new elements as time permits. Take note of what kind of elements they chose to implement, and suggest elements that require different syntax or attributes.

### Instructors and TAs

Encourage students to rely on the documentation for this activity. Just this once, **do not directly help students write code.** You may need to reiterate this **Employer Competitive Note:** from earlier:

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:**:** Professional programmers do not have every element and attribute memorized. Frontend developers in the workplace need to be resourceful enough to find answers on their own.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Students should share their screens while working through this activity, so that TAs can monitor their work and provide support.

### Deliverable

Students should submit a link to a pen with at least five semantic HTML elements.


## SLIDE 52
## 9. Instructor Do: Semantic Sandbox Activity Review (5 min)

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: When students respond to one of the questions below, open their pen and share it with the class.

> **Ask:**

- "How did the documentation help you?"

- "Do you have any questions that the documentation wasn't able to answer?"

- "Which elements did you try to implement?"

Take note of which elements are common among the class and discuss those further. For example:

- If many students tried to implement a video element, ask about their goals; did they think videos are important in UX/UI, or did they think it would be easy?

- If many students avoided or gave up on a the input element, bring up the documentation for inputs. Address the sticking points and reinforce how to follow the W3C examples.

Share some ccommon pitfalls that students might encounter during this activity:

- Some elements (like `img`) use self-closing tags. These elements cannot contain content, and do not require closing tags.

- Some elements (like `li`) must be nested within another element (like `ol`). Students may try to implement one without the other.

- Some elements (like `nav`) do not have any visible qualities to separate them from other elements. These are for organization and accessibility only.

- Some elements (like `input`) behave wildly differently depending on many optional attributes. For these, more specific documentation (like [HTML \<input type="email">](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_email.asp)) is often required.

Now that students have a grasp on HTML and how to use it to create webpages, we'll move into the third part of today's lesson: CSS. But first, a break. 

> **Instructor Note:** Let students know that you are available to provide individual feedback during the break.

### What is CSS?

> **Ask:** "Does anyone know what HTML stands for?"

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
- A Style Sheet is the code version of a Style Guide: a set of standards for how a document should look.
- "Cascading" refers to the way a browser picks between conflicting rules: more specific rules always take priority.

> :key: **Key Tech Note:** CSS was invented by a colleague of Tim Berners-Lee 4 years after he created HTML. It was made specifically for use with HTML.

**CSS is the standard language for controlling how webpages look.** Pure HTML webpages always look the same: black text on a white background. CSS is used to change that.

**CSS rules are instructions for how to style content.** CSS and HTML are partners in crime. CSS rules target specific HTML elements and define how they should look. CSS does not work without HTML.

Use the analogy of a body:
- HTML is the skeleton. It provides structure and organization, but typically remains unseen.

- CSS is skin, hair, even clothes. It determines how the body looks, but can't change the underlying organization or functionality.

This CSS rule applies a yellow color to all anchor elements on the page.

1. A CSS rule starts with a **selector** that determines which HTML elements are affected. The selector `a` selects all anchor elements, because that's the tag used to create anchor elements. Writing something other than `a` would change which elements turn yellow.

## SLIDE 66
1. After the selector is the **declaration block start**, which is always an open curly brace. Point out the matching closing curly brace at the end of the rule.

	> :key: **Key Tech Note:** Curly braces are used to group a set of properties or statements in almost all programming languages. It's good practice to immediately type a closing brace after the opening brace—CodePen and VS Code will do this automatically!

## SLIDE 67
1. Inside the declaration block (between the curly braces) are **properties**. Just like attributes in an HTML element, there can be any number of properties in one CSS rule.

	There are even more CSS rules than HTML attributes, so a reliance on documentation is just as essential.

## 12. Instructor Do: CSS Selectors Demo (5 min)

1. Open [this pen](https://codepen.io/2u-uxuxi-bootcamp/pen/VwpmRJK), which is similar to what students should have after the Semantic Sandbox activity.

1. Select paragraph elements and change the font size.

	```css
	p { font-size: 30px; }
	```

1. Show that multiple properties can be used in one CSS rule by changing the text color of paragraph elements. Use one of the named colors.

	```css
	p {
		font-size: 30px;
		color: red;
	}
	```

1. Select text area elements and change the background color. Use a hexadecimal color.

	```css
	textarea {
		background-color: #123456;
	}
	```

> Instructor Notes:
>
> - Before introducing the next activity, pause to answer any questions.
>
> - It's likely that students will ask about styling individual paragraphs instead of all three. Let them know that this can be done by using advanced selectors, which we'll talk about in 17.2.

## 13. Student Do: Add Some Color Activity (15 min)

**TAs:** Slack out the activity file: [17.1-03-Add-Some-Color](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K9gtTZhiwi5aOWa9qZ0LudCGbI4vAgMtQhTAIVL4aK4/edit?usp=sharing). 

### Summary

Students will build upon the Semantic Sandbox activity by adding three CSS properties.

### Instructions

Students will select paragraph elements, apply the `color` and `background-color` properties, then select any other HTML element and apply either property.

_If students struggle:_ Reference the demo from the previous section. Guide students through each step.

_If students complete the activity early:_ Encourage students to try out different color formats by referencing the [W3C Color Converter](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp).

### Instructors and TAs

Monitor students and offer to help those who are struggling. Consider doing a quick demo if necessary.

### Deliverable

Students should submit a link to a pen with CSS rules that color paragraph elements and one other HTML element.

## SLIDE 74
## 14. Instructor Do: Add Some Color Activity Review (5 min)

> **Ask:** "What was different about writing your first CSS versus your first HTML? Was it harder or easier?"

Students should understand how CSS rules relate to HTML elements: a rule selects and element and applies CSS properties.

Share some common misconceptions about working with CSS rules:

- "CSS rules affect all of one type of HTML element."

	_CSS selectors can actually get a lot more advanced, allowing developers to select any specific element on the page. We'll talk more about this in 17.2_

- "CSS properties only change the way a page looks."

	_While much of CSS is about color, size, and spacing, some properties can dramatically affect the way a site is used. For example, CSS can be used to determine which text can be highlighted and copied._

> **Instructor Note:** If students have questions about the basic parts of a CSS rule, refer again to the "Anatomy of a CSS Rule" slide.

1. How to manipulate fonts with CSS: have **TAs** Slack out the documentation: [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp).

   - font-family: This property is used to control which fonts display on the web. There are three options that are passed to it. These serve as fallback fonts.


## SLIDES 78-79
   - font-style: This controls if a font displays as normal (which is default), italic, or oblique.


## SLIDE 80-81
   - font-size: This controls the pixel size of your fonts.


## SLIDE 82-83
   - font-weight: This controls the weight of the font. Options are from 100 (light) to 900 (black). Only values in intervals of 100 can be specified.

   These are the basic methods of manipulating fonts but can be very powerful. Practicing your typography on the web will help you build nicer layouts.

## SLIDE 84
2. Height and width of elements: you can see elements that you are styling with the outline property!

- Height: Controls the pixel height of an element.
- Width: Controls the pixel width of an element. The width can also be specified as a percentage to tell the element how much of its container it should take up.
- Outline: Outlines create the outside of the HTML element, similar to borders, except they don't affect the box model.
  - Outlines are particularly useful when you're building new layouts.

## 16. Instructor Do: Fonts on the Web Demo (5 min)

Adding custom fonts on the web used to be a complicated process, but thanks to our friends at Google, the process is far more manageable.

During this demo, you'll show students how to add custom fonts to their web projects.

**Instructions**

1. Navigate to [https://fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com).

2. Click the "+" button on any of the fonts. Pick your favorite! A tab will appear on the bottom right of your screen.

   ![Step 1 Google Fonts](Images/fonts_step1.png)

3. Copy the link tag, as shown in the image below. This will be added to your web project at the head of the page.

   _Note:_ Google also provides instructions on how to use your font in CSS.

   ![Step 2 Google Fonts](Images/fonts_step2.png)

4. Add the font to the head of your document. You're ready to use your chosen font on your web project.

![Step 3 Google Fonts](Images/Fonts_step3.png)

Doing is believing. Next, students will practice their knowledge of CSS with a hands-on activity.

### Summary

Students will style three separate HTML elements in any way they want.

### Instructions

Students will select at least 3 separate HTML elements and apply 2 CSS properties to each. Students may not use the same property more than once, so they should have at least 6 unique properties.

_If students struggle:_ Direct students to the [this guide on styling images](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp), which should get them started.

_If students complete the activity early:_ Encourage students to create and style even more elements&mdash;repetitive practice is very useful at this stage.

### Instructors and TAs

Provide feedback on code style, specifically indentation and semicolon use, which may not prevent the code from working.

Suggest properties that may help students with the unique elements on their pages. For example, the `border` property is particularly useful when dealing with tables.

### Deliverable

Students should submit a link to a pen with at least six unique CSS properties used across at least three separate CSS rules.

## 18. Student Do: Style Your Page Peer Review (10 min)

Call attention back to your screen. 

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Create breakout rooms for students to gather into critique teams of two to four people each.

- Pick a couple of examples from the Slack channel to display.
- In each group, students should consider the following questions:
  - What about the design is working?
  - What could the designer have done differently?
  - What would you do differently?
- Have student groups place their feedback on the Slack channel once they have had a few minutes to discuss the work.

Take questions then move on to wrap up today's class.

## 19. Instructor Do: Recap (5 min)

Review what we learned in class today. Take a moment and ask the class if they have any questions regarding HTML and CSS.

> **Ask:**

1. "What is frontend development?"

	_Frontend development is the creation of the "front" parts of a the web: those that users see and touch. A frontend developer writes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript._

1. "What does HTML stand for?"

	_Hypertext Markup Language. Hypertext is text that links to other text. A Markup Language is a kind of programming language used to structure content._

1. "What are the parts of an HTML element?"

	_Opening and closing tags, attributes, and content. Tags determine an element's type, attributes determine an element's specifics, and content is everything inside an element._

1. "What is the difference between syntax and semantics?"

	_Syntactically correct code works as expected, with no errors. Semantically correct code is human-readable and uses each element only for its intended purpose._

1. "What does CSS stand for?"

	_Cascading Style Sheet."Cascading" refers to the way CSS rules resolve conflicts when more than one rule affects any given element._

1. "What are the parts of a CSS rule?"

	_Selector, declaration block, and properties. Selectors determine which elements will be affected, and properties determine how those elements will be affected. Declaration blocks (curly braces) assign sets of properties to selectors._

1. "Why is documentation important?"

	_Not even the world's greatest developers have everything memorized. Referencing documentation is the only way to the specific uses and requirements of every element, attribute, property, etc._

After covering these general points, turn review to the class. Ask if anyone has specific questions or publicly debug the pen of a student who asks for help&mdash;other students likely have the same questions.

Be sure to invite students who want feedback or who have questions to stay online for office hours.

## 20. Instructor Do: Introduce Challenge 17 and End Class (5 min)

**TAs:** Slack out the link to this week's challenge:

- [17-Week/04-Homework/01-Instructions/Unit 17 Homework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qza5kjzQndXKbooropUxE4nefYfpg4FezHh24TzUmOY/)

This week’s challenge is for students to create the basic HTML structure for their portfolio webpages. Students will also apply basic CSS properties they have learning during class.

**Prompt:** You’re a new developer and probably wondering, “Where do I start?” All developers start with small, easy-to-digest projects. Creating the basic structure is the first step to creating your portfolio webpage. You’ll push your webpage up to GitHub and publish it on GitHub Pages so that friends, family, and TAs can see your work.

Students will:

- Create a GitHub repository and pull the blank repo to their computers.
- Create an appropriate folder structure inside of the blank repo they just cloned to hold their working files. Project folder > images / CSS / index.html.
- Create the HTML file and structure of the wireframe.
- Style the wireframe using CSS to make their layout unique.
- Push their changes back to GitHub and publish to GitHub pages.

Remind students about office hours, take any final questions, and wish the class a good night.
