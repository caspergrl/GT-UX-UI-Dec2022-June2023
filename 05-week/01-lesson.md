## Overview

Today, students will practice presenting their work and receive critique from instructional staff. Afterward, they have a working session to complete their user experience (UX) case study due the following class.

> **Instructor Note:** Next class (5.2), students will begin a three-week group project. **Encourage students to work diligently to finish their UX case studies by the next class so that assignments don't overlap, and they can focus on their first group project.**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Present information to an audience through a prototype.

2. Provide constructive feedback to their peers.

3. Write a case study outline for their challenge.

## Class at a Glance

- Today's class is all about student presentations and learning the importance of sharing their design work.

## Preparing for Class

- **Review the lecture slides:**
    [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/05.1 Case Study Presentations Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HUa6CLWK02zm5dNsfzIYodd7trGB_6bFULqDMGh0d9I/edit?usp=sharing).
- **Practice using Zoom:** 
    - It takes time to become proficient using Zoom, the primary online instructional tool. Please refer to the following guide for help performing essential online teaching tasks (sharing screens, managing presentation feedback, etc.):
    - [Zoom Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MtogY4tO4aMPgQ0mlHpdtvi8rmkt9efN__mBngs9tg/edit).

- **Prepare for student presentations.**
  - Today there will be time for six student presentations. Most students will be intimidated when it comes to presenting work in front of their peers. Be sure to build up their confidence.
  - This class is about setting students up for success during the rest of the course. We want students to grasp the importance of storytelling while sharing work. We want them to internalize the case study process.
  - After their prototype presentation, students will answer questions from you, teaching assistants (TAs), and classmates. Providing feedback is critical for the students, so make sure you follow the advice in this plan.
  - Students will be nervous. It is important to set a supportive tone by instructing the class to clap before a student starts his or her presentation and after it ends.
  - Many students new to design are not comfortable with the idea of sharing work that feels incomplete, and they're even more uncomfortable with the idea of critique. Part of your challenge is to help students build the inner confidence that they'll need to succeed.

  - If needed, review [Strategies for Class Online](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/ux-ui-curriculum-version2/tree/master/01-lesson-plans/05-Week#strategies-for-class-online). 


## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Encourage students to log in early and use the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging those students who arrive early to participate in office hours.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (2 min)

### Welcome to class!

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Start the class with a quick engagement tactic to keep the energy high.

- Open today's lecture slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/05.1 Case Study Presentations Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HUa6CLWK02zm5dNsfzIYodd7trGB_6bFULqDMGh0d9I/edit?usp=sharing).

- Let the class know that today will be focused on presenting their prototypes and learning about best practices for prototypes. They will also be learning about creating UX case studies for their portfolios.

### Walk through today's learning objectives.

Review the value in practice and presenting your work.

## 2. Instructor Do: Presenting Design Work (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to help students understand the importance of communicating their work in a professional environment. Presentation is an essential skill in being a great user experience (UX)/user interface (UI) designer. This lecture prepares students for today's first learning objective, presenting information to an audience through a prototype.

### Presenting design work:

Ask, **"Did you know 70% of employed Americans say that presentation skills are critical for career success?"**

- **TAs**, Slack out the related Forbes article:
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/09/25/new-survey-70-percent-say-presentation-skills-critical-for-career-success/#4af2bbef8890](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/09/25/new-survey-70-percent-say-presentation-skills-critical-for-career-success/#4af2bbef8890)

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, presenting your work is relevant to the industry because presentation skills are highly sought after for working with clients, stakeholders, and teams. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how your presentation skills have been central to your work in design. 

### Why UX designers need to learn how to share their work:

As designers, we’re extremely creative and passionate people who pour our hearts and souls into design solutions. But we often lose this passion when we present our concepts to clients. Submitting design work incorrectly can create a vacuum for clients to provide misdirected or overly prescriptive feedback, which leads to subpar final work. Proper presenting skills help clients see our point of view and ultimately allow us to put designs out into the world that we’re proud to put our names on. Here are some thoughts for students' next presentation.

- Today we'll work on improving these presentation stories.

### The benefits of presentation skills:

- Increases self-confidence
- Develops effective communication through semi-public sharing
- Demonstrates knowledge to teams, stakeholders, and fellow designers

Presentations require practice and will be expected of designers throughout their careers.

“I think communication skills are what set apart good designers from great ones.”
Tom Greever - VP Product & Design, Handled
Author of Articulating Design Decisions.

- TAs, Slack out book recommendation: [https://www.amazon.com/Articulating-Design-Decisions-Communicate-Stakeholders/dp/1491921560](https://www.amazon.com/Articulating-Design-Decisions-Communicate-Stakeholders/dp/1491921560)

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Open the Amazon link and show students how to add this book to their wishlist.

### Tell us your story.

When students present, they tell the story about how their design came to be. Students should work through each section of the design and explain their rationale. Talk about the design, its benefits, and how it solves the project goals (but avoid explaining what they can obviously see right in front of them).

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how you use story when presenting design work or prototypes to clients.

-  When a design team just walks a client through a series of wireframe screens in a deck alone, it can be extremely boring. Why? Because the clients are just watching rather than being engaged. This is where making clickable prototypes can change this dynamic. Putting an idea in clients' hands and letting them click around the solution builds trust and makes meetings productive. 

  - Your clients are not UX/UI designers, but they are looking to you to help them evaluate and articulate a better solution. Use your presentation skills and prototypes to allow your clients to participate in a meeting where decisions are made.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:**  Share a quick anecdote about presenting wireframe prototypes to clients. If you feel comfortable sharing the work with your students, take a poll of how many students want to see it and share it during office hours.

### Review the presentation tips.

Presenting is essential to a designer's career. Excellent presenters are not born. They become great by honing their skills and taking opportunities to practice presenting.

### Be confident.

Many students are not used to how designers work. They're uncomfortable with sharing work that feels incomplete and they often find the critique itself distressing. Help students build the inner confidence that they'll need to succeed.

- Use eye contact strategically.
- Speak to the back of the class.
- Use wireframes to focus on functionality, not aesthetics.
- Use mockups and animation to guide the imagination.
- Share personal challenges along the way.
- Hold a Q&A post-presentation.
- Over-deliver!

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Invite a TA to share their input on confidence when presenting.

Let's discuss where presentations can go wrong.

### Why UX design presentations go wrong:

- You are not respecting your audience.
  - Nothing will kill a presentation faster than insulting the audience.
- Trying to do too much in a limited amount of time.
  - If you have 10 minutes, consider limiting to <20 slides. (~30 sec per slide.)
- Not respecting the physical space in which a presentation occurs.
  - For example, using typography under 12 pts in an auditorium projection.
- Lacking practice or experience with presenting a solution.
  - Practice makes perfect and every experience makes us grow. 
  - Practice can prevent you from fumbling with the presentation materials. If your prototype is preloaded or, even better, embedded into your presentation, it can limit jumping around different technology.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Model or sample these issues with your slide presentation if you feel comfortable showing students how these issues are problematic.

### Common issues include:

- Talking UX jargon to laypersons.
- Relying on wireframes alone to get the point across.
- Failing to validate ideas before presenting them.
- Making presentations too short or too long.
- Experiencing performance anxiety.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Invite a TA to share their input on common issues or what can go wrong.

### Practice, practice, practice.

- If students want a presentation to be great, they must test it through practice.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions before moving on.

Next, explain how presentation critique fits into the picture. 

## 3. Instructor Do: Presentation Critique (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is for students to grasp the importance of feedback in the design process. This lecture prepares students for today's second learning objective, providing constructive feedback to their peers.

Start by inviting students to think about times in their lives when feedback they were given on their work made them better at it, even if that feedback was hard to take.

### How Do Designs Get Better?

- Critique and iteration:

  - "Looks great" will not help the user.
  - Starting today, we’re going to give **tough, thoughtful, and detailed feedback for every critique.**

Remind students to apply critiquing methods with work colleagues and peers alike. Designers should become comfortable with critique.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, providing critique and constructive feedback to design team members is relevant because how fundamental it is to the iteration process. Your ability to give actionable feedback can make you a valuable team member.  

### Why Is Critique Important?

- As designers, we don’t design in a vacuum.
- Critique is an opportunity:
  - To build consensus.
  - To drive iteration.
  - To articulate why the designer did what they did.
  - To explain the designer's idea to reviewers who don’t see design as clearly.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a way in which critique has improved your work or made a project better.

### Review the "I Like, I Wish" Critique Method

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Demo the I Like, I wish method with a TA to model the behavior.

- Students are probably familiar with the general idea of the "I Like, I Wish" method.
- It's like a "Yes/No Sandwich," when one says yes about one thing, but no about another. "Yes, I'd love to come to your party; no, I can't bring snacks."

Example: "I Like, I Wish"—designer versus reviewer:

- First, we get context about the problem the designer is trying to solve. Next, the reviewer provides "I Like, I Wish" feedback.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Invite a TA to share their experience with the "Like/Wish" critique method.

### When a Designer Is Critiqued.

- Remind students:
  - The critique isn’t about *them*.
  - The critique is about the *design*.
  - Focus on understanding the feedback.
  - Ask questions of the person critiquing ("why?").
  - Make sure you understand how to improve your design.
  - Remember, it's all about the end user.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions before moving on.

Next, students are going to road-test what they just learned by presenting and critiquing their prototypes. 

## 4. Student Do: UX Prototype Presentations Activity (65 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is for students to present their UX prototypes and provide a critique.

Congratulate the class on developing their challenge to a state worth presenting. Assure them that they should take pride in what they have done over a mere four weeks of training!

**Summary**:

~4-6 students will present their UX prototypes. 

**Instructions:**

There is time for 4-6 prototype presentations.

Here's the presentation breakdown:

- 8 minutes: student prototype presentation
- 5 minutes: feedback from instructional staff and students

*Part 1: Presentation Volunteers and setup:*

- Ask students if anyone wants to volunteer to present their prototype. 

  - If no student volunteers, select one.

- Have the student share their screen in Zoom and prototype with the class in Slack.

- Call on the first presenter.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Have all students go on mute during the presentation. 

*Part 2: UX prototype presentations:*

> Instructors and TAs: Don't say anything during the presentation. You don't want your voice to interrupt their flow.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: When a minute remains in the presenter's allotted time, hold up a sticky note to your camera in order to let the student know that it's time for them to wrap up their presentation.

- Take 5 minutes for critique and questions about the prototype and presentation.

  - Let the TAs—and classmates—ask questions.

  - Go last. Let students practice pointing out the most important successes and failures of the presenters' designs. Once the Q&A session ends, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.

**Extend Presentations into Office Hours:** 

If the class is responsive and wishes to continue presentations, you may elect to extend presentations into office hours.

Next, give everyone a break. After the break, you'll talk about what goes into creating case studies. 

## 5. Break (15 min)

Brain breaks are an important part of the learning process, so take a break! Get up from your screen and relax, have a bite to eat, and drink some water.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Don't stop sharing your screen! Put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual time will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

## 6. Instructor Do: Iterating Case Studies for Engagement (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** This section aims to help students understand the importance of communicating their work as a case study. This lecture prepares students for today's third, and last, learning objective: writing a case study outline for their challenge.

Design portfolios are an essential part of the hiring process in the design world. No matter where a designer's portfolio is hosted or how it was created, the portfolio helps to communicate how a designer approaches solving design problems. 

The people viewing a designer's portfolio want to know more about the projects, how that designer will fit in, and the process they followed to reach the final result. We communicate this information through case studies.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Case studies have become the accepted "test" by which hiring managers choose which candidates to talk to. As a UX/UI designer, writing case studies is the best way to communicate your knowledge of the design process. 

**Engage students by asking:** "When have you presented examples of your work in the past, whether as part of a job interview or to share your work with peers?"    

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Have students engage by raising their hands to speak or by addressing the question via Slack! *Tip:* Students more readily grasp a new concept when they can relate to it through something familiar to them.

### Case studies are all about showcasing one's design process.

The design thinking process should be evident in the case study. It should include each phase to reinforce the designer's thinking.

Reiterate the design thinking steps: empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test.

- Students should be starting to memorize these steps. Periodically quiz them.

### Case studies are about communication.

Share the quote from Danielle Reid, Head of Design at Toptal.com. 

“This communication ability is important for displaying the ability to work in teams, as well as communicate to clients. Designers need to express their ideas to a team, and make the design scalable so that junior or senior designers can pick up the work and move forward with it.”

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a personal story about the importance of communication in your professional experience.

**TAs,** Slack out:

- [https://www.toptal.com/designers/digital/design-talk-presenting-portfolio](https://www.toptal.com/designers/digital/design-talk-presenting-portfolio)

> **Instructor Note:** Pause to see if students have any questions. 

### Review how case studies are an industry expectation.

Hiring managers want to understand how designers solve problems:
Share the user research, research reports, sketches, wireframes, user flows, wireframes, user stories, user journey maps, prototypes, user testing, and the final prototype in a presentation product.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how your own portfolio and case studies have boosted your career.
>
> - Invite a TA to share as well. 

### Seven steps to laying out a case study in a UX design portfolio.

Walk through the seven steps that a designer would take to lay out a case study in a UX design portfolio.

1. Talk about the design problem and the hypothesis for solving it.

   - What problems did the designer observe while watching the users?
   - What did the stakeholders ask the designer to build?
   - Was there a difference between what the designer heard versus what they saw?
   - How did the designer set up to solve that problem?

2. Talk about a designer's specific role and how they collaborated with others on the team.

   - Rarely are we ever alone on our own UX island. Potential employers want to hear how designers collaborate with others, and how their work integrates with the rest of a cross-functional team. They can talk about their facilitation skills here and how their work impacted the team.

3. Next, introduce the designer's solution and how they came up with it.

   - This is where the "pretty pictures" come in, whether they're screenshots or high-fidelity mock-ups. Explain how the designer came to the ultimate decision that this was going to be the best solution for their users.

4. Talk about how the designer's solutions solve the problem.

   - What can the designer's users do now that they couldn't do before?
   - How does this solution change their daily lives?

5. Talk about the challenges the designer has faced.

   - Were there additional design concepts that the designer came up with that could be shown here? Sketches, journey maps, and photos from workshops or usability testing give a sneak peek into the nitty-gritty of their process.
   - This is what potential employers want to see. It may feel messy and unfinished to the designer, but this is the bulk of their process, and it's incredibly important for people who are trying to envision what it's like to work with the designer.

6. Communicate how the project affected users and the business.

   - Did the designer notice an increase in user satisfaction?
   - Or an increase in adoption or engagement?
   - Use tangible numbers here whenever possible.

7. Lastly, talk about what the designer learned.

   - When the designer finishes creating a case study for the portfolio, they should seek feedback from those who view it, whether they're colleagues or interviewers.
   - Another set of eyes on the designer's portfolio will help catch spelling and grammar errors, confusion about content, and the overall usability of the format that they chose. The designer's portfolio will always be a work in progress.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

Now, go deeper into case studies by sharing a few tips for great case studies. 

## 7. Instructor Do: UX Case Study Tips (5 min)

> **Instructor Note:** If you have personal case studies you want to share, use them as samples. If not, share some case study samples.

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to share key tips with students so they can improve their case studies.

Here, you will walk through various tips for creating effective case studies.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** As you walk through the following tips, pick one that you can share an anecdote about, sharing how applying the tip has improved your case studies. 
>
> - Invite a TA to share as well. 

### Review Case Study Tips.

**Tip 1: Eliminate photos of sticky notes that can't be read.**

Nothing says a designer doesn't care about the audience more than just a bunch of sticky notes with no context. Use photos of the process meaningfully.

- Show context and relevant details in a case study.

**Tip 2: Show images of the process.**

Sketches matter; don't just show the final product.

- Sketches and wireframes are essential to include, but show them being used in context.

- Narrate while sharing sketches to show the process.

**Tip 3: Help the viewer better understand what to focus on.**

Direct the viewer's attention by highlighting important areas of interest.

**Tip 4: Title/label all sketches, wireframes, and mockups.**

Intentionally label the images for context. Do not assume the viewers know what they're looking at. Titles/labels help viewers follow the actions and intentions behind a user’s journey.

- Consider that audience members are not familiar with the designer's work or process. Don't assume they know what they're looking at.

**Tip 5: Export mockups at 2X resolution!**

- Do not share resources that are low resolution.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause and check in with your students. Take any questions.

- **TAs,** Share case study example resources in Slack for students to review at home.

Next, students will jump into an activity that will give them practice creating their own case studies.

## 8. Student Do: Case Study Outline Activity (20 min)

**TAs,** Slack out the two files:

Case Study Outline Activity Instructions: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cXcm6TMBFmzudB2ApSIEcA3YphxCRhsg72NP5XqxcKg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cXcm6TMBFmzudB2ApSIEcA3YphxCRhsg72NP5XqxcKg/edit?usp=sharing).

Case Study Outline Template: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FQC82-O3zGd6PGMCLgq3V9i7XSpD1ucJiHbZ3o4f8-Y](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FQC82-O3zGd6PGMCLgq3V9i7XSpD1ucJiHbZ3o4f8-Y).

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Keep everyone in the main Zoom room during this activity. With the TAs, monitor the students as they work and offer encouragement where needed. If many students have the same question or get stuck on the same issue, have everyone pause and watch your screen while you provide guidance. 

**Summary:**

Students will work on extending their UX prototypes into a case study portfolio piece.

**Instructions:**

First, students will complete a case study outline. Next, they will start working on executing their case study, which is starting on their challenge assignment.

**Deliverable**:

In this activity, students will produce a UX case study outline that will help pull together assets and complete their challenge for this week.

## 9. Instructor Do: Case Study Outline Activity  Review (10 min)

Time is up. Call the class back to attention. Ask students to share their outlines in Slack.

**Hold critique.**

Review one to two students' outlines:

- Scan through the work posted to Slack.
- Pull up a student's outline plan.
- In-person class: Ask the student to come to the front of the class to present their work. Online Recommendation Ask a student to present their work on Zoom. 
- They should walk through each section of their outline.

**Provide feedback.**

Ask the TAs to offer critique and provide your own feedback. Feedback prompts:

- Is the story clear and concise overall?
- What works well?
- What could be improved?

## 10. Student Do: Case Study Working Session (40 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to give students time to work on their case study challenge.

**Summary**

This working session lets students wrap up their UX prototype and case study before beginning their first group project.

**Instructions**

Encourage the students to make progress on their UX case study challenge.

**Support students as they learn.**

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Keep everyone in the main Zoom room during this working session. With the TAs, monitor the students as they work and offer encouragement where needed. If many students have the same question or get stuck on the same issue, have everyone pause and watch your screen while you provide guidance. 

- Remind students to focus and complete their work now, so it doesn't impact their upcoming group project.
- Some students become overwhelmed or get stuck planning their case studies. Providing context helps:
  - Remind them that this upfront work in preparing a case study outline and gathering their design process assets (sticky notes, doodles, sketches, and wireframe exports) will help them later when they need to assemble all these visuals together into a UX case study for their portfolios.
  - A strong effort now will yield meaningful outcomes for their challenge.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Feel free to open a countdown clock on your screen to give students a sense of urgency. Alternatively, give students a time check warning at the 15- and 5-minute marks.

**Deliverable**

Some students will have completed a majority of their UX case studies. During office hours or after class, students will complete, then iterate, their case studies. 

> **Instructor Note:** Don't let students just exit the class. The time they have to work is limited, so they should make the most of this opportunity to work.

## 11. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)

> **Instructor Note:** Office hours are a great time to provide students who didn't present earlier an opportunity to share their work.

### Congratulate the class.

Your class is almost done with their first UX case study! 

Congratulate your students: they're progressing well and quickly learning the user-centered design process!

### Preview the next three weeks.

Encourage students to push through to finish their challenge. Why? Because next class, we'll kick off a three-week design sprint! The design sprint will be the students' first group project. 

Remind them that design does not happen in a silo but within *teams*. That's why we'll do three group projects throughout the course. This group project is meant for students to start to master the UX process as they repeat the process they've learned over the previous four weeks.

### Review Concepts.

It's time to review the concepts that were introduced today, which helps students retain what they learned.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Have students engage by raising their hands to speak or by answering the concepts review questions via Slack. 

- What are the benefits of being able to present design ideas through a prototype?
  - *Answer:* To articulate your UX/UI design process and tell a story about how you solved a problem.  
- What is important to remember when presenting constructive feedback to teammates? 
  - *Answer: Use the "I like..., I wish..." method and consider how feedback can help improve a prototype, presentation, or designer's process.  
- What are the best practices or tips used for creating an effective case study?
  - *Answer:* Effective case studies walk through a process meaningfully. Case studies show design deliverables, including sketches, failures, and where data and user feedback validated ideas.

Remind everyone about your office hours, which are after class.

Say, **"If anyone has questions about the challenge, now is a great time to ask!"**

Thank everyone for their hard work today, and stay online for office hours.
