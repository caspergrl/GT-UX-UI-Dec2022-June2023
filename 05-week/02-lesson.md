# 5.2 Lesson Plan: Welcome to Group Project 1: Day 1

---

## Overview

Today's class will introduce students to Group Project One, the first independent group project. Student groups will have about three weeks to apply and work through the design thinking process and practice skills they've learned. They'll work in groups to create a mobile app prototype along with a presentation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today’s class, students will:

1. Form student groups and generate ideas.
2. Create a proto-persona.
3. Draft an interview plan.
4. Define a hypothesis statement.
5. Set up a survey using Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or Google Forms.
6. Give constructive feedback on interview plans.
7. Submit a project proposal.

## Class at a Glance

First off, welcome to Group Project One. This is the students' first group project. This project develops the students' ability to execute the design thinking process through mobile consumer app product design.

Today's class is divided into two parts:

1. The first involves introducing the project, placing students into groups, generating ideas, and setting up a Trello board.
2. The second part is a working session for students to start creating the deliverables due in the next class.

- You will give a demo in Section 8 on the Kanban approach.

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).


## About Group Project One

This project aims to get students to use the design process that they learned over the last four weeks to identify a problem that people have and create a solution.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keeping the energy high and being enthusiastic about what students produce is key. 

***What is the instructional role in Group Project One?***

> **Instructor Note:** Three weeks might sound like ample time, but it goes by in a flash. Use your own preparation as a key to students’ success.

Over the next three weeks, you'll support students while they apply the design thinking process. Your help will be necessary throughout these weeks, as user-centered thinking is still new to students. Specifically, you'll support them in the following ways:

- Guiding groups to focus on executing the design thinking process.
- Helping groups stay productive while in class and set goals outside of class.
  - Keep students accountable and model accountability during standups to support their progress.

***Help Students Avoid Scope Creep***

You play a critical role in helping students to get focused, stay focused, and manage their project scope. 

Without your help, many students will take an unfocused approach to their projects and give weak presentations. Help them keep their focus narrow. While three weeks is not enough time to solve the world hunger problem, it’s enough time to help improve a particular food donation flow.

The Group Project is designed with support integrated to prevent students from steering off course. These supports include:

1. The deliverables and requirements for each day are clearly outlined in the project instructions.
2. Scheduled class standups support interaction with instructional staff about the projects.
3. In-class workshops and working sessions that enable groups to collaborate, get feedback from instructional staff, and set goals to achieve in their project presentations.

Work with the TAs to continuously evaluate student groups' goals and make recommendations for limiting the scope of their projects. 

***Structure of Group Project One***

> **Instructor Note:** Be sure to read through the student-facing Group Project 1 instructions: [Trilogy-UX/UI Master Curriculum>05-07-Group-Project-1>02-Activities>05.2 Group Project 1 Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y/edit).

- Your first task is to organize students into groups of three.
- Students begin the project by ideating on potential ideas. Starting with ideation may seem counterintuitive, but here’s why it works:
  - Ideation provides students with a launching point from which they can go out and generate research.
  - Students are working in groups that require collaboration and consensus. Getting teams enthusiastic about their problem space and working together is essential to driving toward a common goal of executing the design thinking process as a group.
  - Students may learn their idea is *not* actually validated by research—an essential discovery that will impact their final design solution.

- The rest of the project will require active project management skills—a learning curve for many students. This means that you and your instructional staff will want to stay one step ahead of student groups and lend support—here’s how:
  - Check in with each group to see how they’re tracking against their deliverables.
  - Have teams report on their progress throughout the design thinking process.
  - Ask if any student is interested in being the designated project manager for each group, and help him or her delegate responsibilities.

Finally, don't underestimate the power of your own enthusiasm to help students enjoy the process!

## Organizing Groups for Group Project One

- **Important**: Students need to be placed into groups of three. 
  - If your class is small, groups of two are acceptable.  
  - Or, if your class does not divide neatly into groups of three, you'll need to adjust the groupings to account for a student pair or two.
- There is only time for ten presentations during presentation day, so please keep that in mind when you're creating student groups. THIS MEANS A MAXIMUM OF TEN GROUPS!
- Ease the burden of facilitating by dividing the student groups among the instructional staff to provide guidance. 
  - Next class, you'll introduce daily scrums, where groups will check in with their assigned staff member. Think of it like the TV show "The Voice" for design projects.

- To save time, organize students into groups of three:

- [Download a copy of the Project 1 Group Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p7lnWB-OQu-J6FdaBGmp10nCCkVw-kAzyJ6jx12FuqY/edit?usp=sharing) to facilitate assigning students to groups.

  - Upload the completed document to your class Google Drive.

![Overview](Images/groups-01.png)

- To keep students on track, divide the groups among the instructional staff.
  - These will be the primary groups you'll workshop with during each class session.

  - The lead instructor and TAs should also float between groups to provide feedback.

- Sometimes feedback from different instructors conflicts and it confuses students. Reassure students that this happens in the workplace. Everyone has their own perspective. It's the students' job to take all of that feedback and use it to inform their decisions.

 ![Overview](Images/groups-02.png)

- **Main goal:** This design challenge is the capstone of the UX portion of the curriculum. Your primary focus will be on shepherding students through the design process. You and your instructional staff will act as mentors and project managers to your young designers.

- **Put on your coach hat:** Students may not finish all of their deliverables on schedule. Sometimes students will fall behind. When this happens, use your coaching skills to encourage students to complete their deliverables. You can help them by encouraging students to execute and by providing positive feedback and constructive suggestions. Let them know they're doing great work so that they feel they're on track for success.

    - [How to be a Great Coach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjqYGkNh5KA)

**Remember:**

1. By the end of the day, students should submit a project proposal to be approved by the instructor and/or TAs.

2. ***Instructors and TAs should not be idle behind the screens of their computers.*** You all should be engaging with students throughout the entire day.

- At your discretion, you and the TAs can implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.

  - In these workshops, student groups will rotate between the instructor and TAs to get help on specific tasks. These workshops should be between 10 to 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Work with your TAs to maximize class time. Prebuild Zoom breakout rooms and have groups create Slack channels with their group members and instructional leads. Have groups also share you on their Figma project, Google drives, Miro board, and InVision prototypes as they get created.

- Be sure to take some time to review a few of the student project examples in class. Students enjoy seeing where the bar is set, and it lets them know what is expected.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (1 min)

- Welcome to class and their first Full Day of Group Project 1!

> **Instructor Note:** Project weeks are where the rubber hits the road. Support your groups and push them to create awesome stuff with their new skills. 

- Launch the lecture slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/05.1-Welcome to Group Project One Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dEMGq_TttmL7UtGxDRshA7GuQ4t1KXzdry4fKpTxzFc).

- Walk students through today's learning objectives.
- Help students get excited about their first group project week by connecting its value to working as a designer in UX/UI. 

## 2. Instructor Do: Introduction to Group Project 1: Day 1 (25 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to give students an overview of what to expect from a "studio" workshop model and introduce  Group Project One.

Students spent the last four weeks learning some key skills about the UX design process. Now it is time for them to apply all of those skills to an independent studio project.

### Introduce Group Project 1:

This project is a great portfolio piece. Students get to design a mobile app that solves a real need in a person's day-to-day life.

- Students will be working in groups of two to three during this project. Students work in groups because designers work in teams in the real world. You don’t get to choose your coworkers! Soft skills are a critical design skillset.

To start the project, we'll pitch ideas and then try to validate those ideas through user and market research.

### Studio workshop model:

This is a studio class. Design studios are fast-paced and oriented toward hands-on exploration. It will feel different from traditional classes.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** This is a great moment to share your own insights about what a design studio environment feels like.

### The mission:

Design a mobile app prototype that solves a real need in a person's day-to-day life. Students will work in groups of three as they research, design, and test a mobile app solution.

- Each team will collaborate on the design thinking process as students execute UX deliverables in and out of class. This class is dedicated to working time and split into workshop sessions.

### Tuckman’s Team Development Stages: Review the 5 stages of team development. 

- **Forming:** The team has just been introduced and everyone is overly polite and pleasant. At the start, most are excited to start something new and to get to know the other team members.

> **Instructor Note:** Today/this week may represent this stage

- **Storming:** The reality and weight of completing the task at hand have now hit everyone.  Personalities may clash. Members might disagree over how to complete a task or voice their concerns if they feel that someone isn’t pulling their weight. Remember that most teams experience conflict.

> **Instructor Note:** This week/next week will likely pass through this stage. Work with you TAs to identify groups in the storming stage early and help resolve conflicts to keep group projects moving forward.

- **Norming:** During the norming stage, people start to notice and appreciate their team members’ strengths. Groups start to settle into a groove. Everyone is contributing and working as a cohesive unit.

> **Instructor Note:** This week/next week will likely pass into this stage. Do your best to get teams into the norming stage as quickly as possible. Groups will like get to this position during the group project. H

- **Performing:** Groups are more confident, motivated, and familiar enough with the project and their team that they can operate without supervision. Everyone is on the same page and driving full-speed ahead towards the final goal..

> **Instructor Note:** By week three some groups will likely pass into this stage. Do your best to keep pushing team to perform all the way to the presentations.

- **Adjourning:** Once a project ends, the group disbands. This phase is sometimes known as mourning because members have grown close and feel a loss now that the experience is over.

> **Instructor Note:** During the next group project some students will want to repeat working with the same group members to repeat the success they had from the first group project. This nostalgia should be recognized but recommend mixing up teams to see if students can practice the group teamwork process again.

- **TAs,** Slack out for groups to review at home: [https://toggl.com/stages-of-team-development/](https://toggl.com/stages-of-team-development/)

- Each team will collaborate on the design thinking process as they execute UX Deliverables in and out of class. This class is dedicated to work time and split into workshop sessions.

### Tips for Successful Teamwork.

Ask, **What makes a good teammate?**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Before moving on, ask students to address that question. They can raise their hand and share, or post their thoughts in Slack.

Successful teamwork requires:

- Making teamwork a priority.

- Clarifying roles, responsibilities, and accountability. For a team to succeed, each member should know what their role/responsibility is in the group, and what the roles/responsibilities of others are.

- Setting clear goals. A team that has specific goals and completion deadlines for tasks will work together more effectively than a team without goals.

- Communicating with each other. Team members need to be able to communicate their thoughts, opinions, ideas, and feelings clearly and openly, positively, and respectfully. Everyone should also listen to each other and ask questions for clarification purposes.

- Making decisions together. Making decisions should be based on open dialogue with all members offering their ideas and solutions to problems.

- Building trust and getting to know each other better. Trust can be gained through each team member demonstrating their accountability for the work assigned to them.

- Celebrating differences/diversity. It is essential to view team members as unique individuals and to concentrate on each member's positive attributes. Having a variety of viewpoints will help you design more widely applicable solutions.

- Examining and improving teamwork processes and practices. A team should be able to discuss team norms and what is stopping them from moving forward and progressing.

### Group Project 1 Deliverables and Requirements:

This is a three-week project.

**TAs,** Slack out and review the [Group Project One Requirements](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y).

- Open the Google Doc in your browser and walk students through the requirements document.

  - In Week 1, students should be executing user research, synthesizing their qualitative data, defining the problem, and ideation.

  - In Week 2, students should be prototyping, testing, and iterating.

  - In Week 3, students will ideally complete the second round of user testing, create a presentation, and then present on the last two days of class.

- Answer any questions and move on to student samples.

### Scope Creep

One of the biggest challenges students will face during their projects is avoiding scope creep. The key is to keep the focus of your project narrow from the start. Once you have a narrow focus, it's important to keep that focus from widening and growing out of scope during the next three weeks.   

> **Say:** "While three weeks is not enough time to solve the world hunger problem, it’s enough time to help improve a particular food donation flow."

The key is to solve one or two specific problems, not all the problems. 

If students keep their focus narrow, their presentations will be clearer and more compelling. 

>  :gem: **Designer Insight:** Bring the importance of scope creep to life by sharing an anecdote from your own work—did a project grow so far out of scope that nothing was accomplished? Alternatively, what about a time that a project's scope so narrowly focused that its outcome was definite and truly successful? 

### **Student examples** 

Review some of the student examples.

If students work hard and execute, they'll create a fantastic case study for their design portfolio! Let's look at some former groups that did excellent work. 


- [Matcher: Connecting Silicon Valley to Local Communities](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YqWYWQZMuRuSWFCygXJUNl42emd61NWrYuAmqnOk0KU/edit?usp=sharing)

- [Opportune](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lg7PAWeXu-MR9Cf2VdybdMK64xxMfTUDFSgst_h-K48/edit?usp=sharing) was created for people to discover virtual micro-volunteer opportunities.

- [Spin](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qPgGwRHayNqgGqT2MjU1UN7kersLo7oPuhPGgEOmBow/edit?usp=sharing) was created to make group decisions easier.

### Student groups:

Review the teams of three.

> **Instructor Note:** Update Slide 24 with the cohort teams.

## 3. Student Do: Group Project 1 Generate Ideas Activity, Parts 1–2 (20 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** For a three-week project, it's essential to get teams focused and working on ideas that aren't too big in scope. The goal of this activity is to help student groups start out in the right direction. 

**TAs,** Slack out the link to the activity instructions: [05-Week/02-Activities/05.2-01-Group-Idea-Pitching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iSeQ6qBySyJdUJa3FDZ_muw8pHOQmCF5ccVHLqjnFyw/edit?usp=sharing).

**Instructor and TAs:**

Begin by helping groups collaborate and choose from existing problems or applications that can be improved through the design thinking process.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Watch and support student groups as they work.

> **Instructor Note:** Groups can be designated to an individual instructional staff member.

**Summary**:

Students groups generate app ideas using sticky notes to extract and select an idea to work on using dot voting. 

Helping groups align on a direction is hard, and this activity is designed to encourage collaboration and use a democratic process to select an idea.

**Instructions:** 

Students have 20 minutes to come up with three to five project directions for mobile apps.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Students will work in teams using Miro. Create breakout rooms and assign TAs to particular groups, as well as yourself. 

1. Gather into groups and create sticky notes.  
2. Type three app ideas on individual sticky notes.

   - Make your ideas as clear as possible; others will be voting on them.

3. Note: The idea selected will then be used by groups to produce a project proposal due by the end of class.
4. When finished, take a screen grab of your screen showcasing your ideas on sticky notes.

**Deliverable**:

In this activity, students will share a screen grab to Slack. 

## 4. Instructor Do: Group Project 1 Generate Ideas Review, Part 3 (5 min)

Close the breakout rooms and bring everyone back to the main Zoom room to review the activity. 

Coordinating with your TAs, review groups' ideas.

- Review the groups' ideas and look for patterns, categories, or interesting directions. 

- Have each team place their top 3 ideas in the class Slack channel.

  - Move quickly through each group and have them share their ideas.

- Questions you could ask to stimulate discussion:
  - Who are you going to talk to first to validate if that is an issue or not? 
  - Why does your group think that idea is worth pursuing? 
  - Look for patterns among groups and ask, "Why do you think that idea keeps coming up?" 

> **Instructor Note:** Multiple groups can work on the same idea. 

- Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about the idea generation process:

  - "You need a problem before you can come up with an idea." *False.* A team could be curious about Kayak and go find a way to improve that booking service. 
  - "Ideas can only happen at the beginning." *False.* You can have many ideas or directions. However, for a three-week project, we need to focus on a direction as a team quickly.

- Finally, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can apply the next time they need to generate ideas:

  - Start human-centered, not app-centered. Use your empathy as much as you can to think about a potential user and consider their needs before thinking about working on X app.
  - Start with big concepts at first, like travel safety, travel customization, or travel privacy to generate ideas as children to those parent concepts.  

> **Instructor Note:** Not every group will need help at this point, so encourage groups to keep moving if they've built up a head of steam. Recommend using the voting feature in Miro [https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017572274-Voting](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017572274-Voting).

## 5. Student Do: Group Project 1 Vote on Ideas Activity, Part 4 (15 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Move student teams back into their breakout rooms. You and the TAs should monitor your assigned teams. 

Continue the activity to select an idea via dot voting for each group.

**Instructions:**  

1. Monitor groups and review their dot voting process.

2. Help groups vote on ideas.

3. Register the winning idea from each group.

- Make sure to encourage your students to capture the voting process: they should take screen grabs throughout the group project weeks.

- Look out for idea ties: if there is a tie within a group, work with those groups to separate the tied ideas and vote again. Each individual gets one more vote.

**Instructor and TAs:** 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** With your TAs, monitor students and offer help where needed. Encourage students to help one another as well.

***How to help teams keep moving:*** Hopefully, groups reach a consensus on a project direction. If there is no consensus among the group members, students will likely need help to align in a single direction. In this situation, ask questions about each option. Get group members to articulate why one choice is better than the other. If necessary, be the deciding vote to help teams keep moving.

## 6. Instructor Do: Group Project 1 Vote on Ideas Review, Part 5 (5 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Close the breakout rooms and have students return to the main Zoom classroom.

Coordinating with your TAs, review groups' chosen app ideas.

Remember, most students are new to dot voting and idea generation.

- Invite TAs and students to take part in discussing the outcome of the activity.

- Some considerations to discuss as you review their chosen direction:
  - How big is their idea direction? The goal is to focus students on a topic they can research and interview users about. 
  - Has the team all come to a consensus? 
  
> **Instructor Note:** If teams are conflicted on their direction, flag them for a working session in the next breakout section.

- Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about generating ideas:

  - "Adding democracy always helps a team." *False.* However, without a method for determining direction, your team can be led by the loudest voice in the room, which isn't necessarily a good outcome.
  - "Team consensus is always best." *True.* Being on the same page keeps everyone moving forward.

- Finally, share an actionable tip that students can directly apply the next time they generate design ideas:

  - Continue to work together and vote on other design deliverables. 

- Congratulate groups on finding a direction. Now the hard work can start!

Now, move on to the next lecture on project management and Kanban.

## 7. Instructor Do: Project Management and Kanban 101 (15 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal with this short lecture is to help students grasp the nature and importance of project management and its methods.

Start by defining project management, then provide examples. From there, move on to walk through the Kanban approach. 

### Project Management.

First, define project management. 

- Project management is the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the team's work to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how project management know-how has played a role in your career. 

### Kanban 101.

Next, give a brief teaser of the Kanban approach. 

A Kanban board is a visual tool that depicts work at various stages of a process. It includes lists that organize Kanban cards into workflows.

- Designers can move Kanban cards around. Moving cards between columns is critical to making the most of a Kanban board. You'll move existing cards more than you make new ones. 

Now, walk through the Kanban Board example.

Finally, go a bit deeper into Kanban in particular.    

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how you've used a Kanban approach in your design projects. 
>
> - Alternatively, invite a TA to share. 

### Kanban boards:

- Encapsulate a project or workflow.

- Are visual tools that depict work at various stages of a process.

- Include lists that organize Kanban cards into workflows.

> :speech_balloon:  **Say:** A traditional project management tool would call the Kanban board a "project" or "workspace."

### Kanban list:

- A list contains a set of related cards—typically those in the same stage of a process—in a titled column on a Kanban board.
  - Lists are sometimes called "lanes."

Note: A traditional project management tool would call the Kanban list a "to-do list" or "task list."

### Kanban card:

- A card will hold an item related to the Kanban board, an item such as a task or product.  

> :speech_balloon:  **Say:** A traditional project management tool would call the Kanban card a "to-do" or "task."

### Moving cards between columns:

- This is critical to making the most of a Kanban board.

- Kanban users move existing cards more often than making new ones.

Review the student example.

> Take questions.

Next, go deeper by giving a demo of a Trello Kanban board. 

## 8. Instructor Do: Demo - Trello Kanban (10 min)

Review the [Trello Board Demo](https://trello.com/invite/b/IsZVl2Qs/695511affb1c4bbbc4d4f15a9d5a1828/project-1-demo).

Now it's time to demo how to set up Trello.

> :speech_balloon:  **Say:** "We're going to demo how to create a board, a list, and a card. We'll demo some basic functionality on the card."

- If you want to show additional features, feel free to do that.

- Groups can then use Trello to track the Group Project 1 tasks.

- By the end of the day, students will submit a link to their project proposals on this project one board.

- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE TRELLO, have students submit project proposals to a Google Drive folder.

Encourage student groups to set up their own Kanban boards in Trello. Students will be creating a new board, four lists, and cards for the tasks they want to accomplish over the next three weeks.

## 9. Break (15 min)

Break time! 

Brain breaks are an important part of the learning process, so take a break! Get up from your screen and relax, have a bite to eat, and drink some water.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Don't stop sharing your screen! Put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual timer will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

## 10. Student Do: Group Project 1 Proposal Activity (5 min)

### Group Project 1 Proposal

Have TAs Slack out the following activity instructions: [05-07-Group-Project-1/02-Activities/05.1/05.1-01-Group Project 1 Proposal Instructions Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11fxGYH31ojclpdwaEpeoZgW3ybY4y95XxDPtLmgpeV0/edit#). Review it with the students, if needed.

**Instructor and TAs:** watch and support students as they work to complete this Group Project 1 Proposal by the end of class.

> **Instructor Note:** Keep students focused on planning and executing the Group Project 1 proposal.

**Summary**:

The remainder of the day is an open working session to complete the Group Project 1 proposals and other Day 1 project requirements.

**Instructions:**

1. Share the Group Project 1 proposal document with each team.
2. Tell everyone they must complete this document before the end of class.

**Instructor and TAs:**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** With your TAs, monitor students and offer help where needed. Encourage students to help one another as well.

Some students may struggle with focusing on one user. Help them focus on just one user.

Other students may struggle with clarity in their proposal. Help them by reading through their proposal and asking questions to improve clarity.

**Deliverable**:

In this activity, students will produce a formalized idea proposal to be shared and reviewed by the instructional staff. Each proposal contains the idea each group is working on for the next three weeks.

## 11. Student Do: Working Session (60 min)

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Working sessions are modeled on a design workshop. Place groups back into breakout rooms and keep 1 group in the main room. With your TAs, mix in with groups and monitor the student groups and help them as needed.

In this working session, the Instructor and TAs can hold workshops or check-ins with each group. The goal is to help groups identify and work on project deliverables and support group dynamics.

> **Instructor Note:** With your TAs, set the expectation for students to produce their project proposals before leaving class for the day. Use the sign-up sheet for groups to get help from you and the TAs.

![Overview](Images/slide.png)

> **Instructor Note:** **Workshop and working studio Tips.** 
>
> - **Important**: Leave the Group Project One Requirements slide up on your screen for students to reference.
> 
> - Help your students plan out their projects and make suggestions to the process as needed. We're repeating the design thinking process, so remind students they're not starting from scratch. Rather, they're practicing what we have already taught them.
> 
> - Here is where the rubber hits the road. Below are suggestions for content to help groups during the working session.
> 
> - **Interview Plans.**
>
> - Students often get stuck when writing interview plans. Spend time helping students think about what they want to learn.
>
> - Refer students back to the [User Interview Sample Questions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vDn65WqjnsoMYG4LWIM18ZaivWR1dHjKVAB72FAFxm8).
>
> - :speech_balloon: > **Say:** "You'll want to send out your survey and conduct user interviews after class and for challenge. You'll need that data for the next class."
>
> - **How to Help Students Get Unstuck:**
>
> - Successful problem solving involves being “stuck.” If students are not getting stuck, then the problems they’re trying to solve aren’t interesting enough.
>
> - Good problem solvers have routines for finding new things to try and getting back on track when they’re stuck.
> 
> - **Some facilitating questions**:
>
>  - Can you walk me through your process?
>  - What is going on in this problem?
>  - Who is your user?
>  - What can you try?
>  - What does this remind you of?
>  - Why isn’t this working?
>  - What are you missing?
>  - Do you need more ideas?
>  - Do you need help?
>  - Did you consider *x*?
>
> **SCENARIO: Coaching and Questioning.**
>
>  - Use the Socratic method. When students ask questions, the instructor’s response should also be a question. One advantage of question-asking over telling is that we're in a better position to monitor students’ learning when they're doing the talking and explaining.
>
> Scenario A: Process facilitation:
>
> - Student: “I don’t know what to do.”
>  - Instructor/TAs: “What do you think you should do?”
>  - Student: “I should do *x*.”
>  - Instructor/TAs: “What steps would you take to do *x*?”
>
> Scenario B: Execution facilitation:
>
> - Student: “Is *x* correct?”
> - Instructor/TAs: “Tell me why you think *x* is correct.”
> - Student: “I think it is correct because of *a + b + c* …”
> - Instructor/TAs: Did you consider *x, y, z*?
>
> - Encourage students to set up an internal dialogue in which they continually ask themselves:
>   - “What do I know?”
>   - “What do I need to know?”
>   - “What techniques do I have for bridging the gap?”
>
> On numerous occasions, students have come for extra help because they were stuck on a multistep problem.
> 
> - After showing their first step, they froze.
> - A facilitator asked them, “Okay, what do you do next?”
> - They did one more step and, once more, stopped.
> - After repeating the question, they did one more step until the problem was solved.
> - Make something, then analyze it, and iterate.
>
> Students will think you were helpful, but point out that all you did was prompt them to continue. Encourage students to take over that job themselves, and then remind them that they should not allow uncertainty to lead to paralysis.

- Working sessions are concentration time. Work to avoid distractions and keep student groups collaborating.

## 12. Instructor Do: Group Project 1 Proposal Review (5 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Close the breakout rooms and return everyone to the main Zoom classroom to review their proposals.

> **Instructor Note:** This is your opportunity to approve group project proposals and encourage student groups on their directions. 
> 
> If a group's proposal is too broad at this point—e.g., they are redesigning Airbnb—help them to focus their proposal. It will help the team execute in the remaining three weeks. 

- Tell every team to place their Group Project 1 proposals in Slack.
- With the remaining time, pull up each proposal and quickly review with the whole class. 
  - Invite peers as well as TAs to contribute feedback and ideas.
- Ideas for proposal review:
    - Ask: What are your team's first tasks at home? 
    - Ask: Who is doing what? 
    - Ask: Does anyone know someone who works at X?

  - Offer encouraging viewpoints on the ideas. Some suggestions:
    - That idea has tons of promise because of x.
    - Your team is right on track. Make sure you all agree on your user's needs.

- Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about design proposals:

  - "Design proposals are not used in the industry." *False.* An RFP: Request For Proposal is common business practice for every design profession.
  - "Proposals should be one page." *False.* Depending on the project, the proposal can be as long or as short as needed. For our three-week project, one page is plenty.

- Finally, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can directly apply to their proposals:

  - Share your proposal with non-designers. Does your idea resonate with them?
  - Put your proposal away for 24 hours. Sleep on it. Come back and re-read it. If the proposal still seems worthy, keep moving forward. If not, create a new one.
     - If not, work with the instructor to quickly get on track.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. Should anyone want more feedback, invite them to stay online for office hours.

## 13. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)

- This wraps up Day 1 of the project week! We are well on our way!
- Take questions.
- Recap key concepts from the day to test students' recall of the information:
  - What do you remember about project management?
    - Answer: Trello is a PM tool.
  - What are Kanban boards and their value?
    - Answer: They visualize tasks and responsibilities.
  - What role does a project proposal have in the design project?
    - Answer: It is a concise document that aligns all stakeholders, UX/UI Designers, and the business side, in this case, your Instructors/TAs. 

- Thank everyone for doing their best work. 

> **Instructor Note:** Next class will include longer working sessions, and we want to maximize the class work time. Encourage groups to make progress and bring their work back to class for feedback. 

- Remember to stay online—office hours are after class.
