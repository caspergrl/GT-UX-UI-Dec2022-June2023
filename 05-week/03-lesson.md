---

## Overview

Today, student groups will continue working on Group Project 1's user research phase and ideally start on the definition phase. You'll introduce the concept of agile project management. You'll also help groups engage in a standup to keep groups moving and staying on task. The rest of the day is dedicated to group workshops and working sessions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will make significant progress on the following tasks:

1. Practice a daily standup.
2. Conduct five user interviews.
3. Create four interview transcripts.
4. Analyze data by creating an affinity diagram.
5. Synthesize data into a user persona *or* empathy map.
6. Provide constructive feedback to peers.
7. Define one user insight.

## Class at a Glance

- Today, you'll talk in-depth about project management. 
- Enable workshop collaboration with project progress check-ins with the Instructor and TAs.
- Take time to share your experience with students.

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Prepare for Class

- Review the lecture slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/05.3-Group Project One, Day Two Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h-tXUSEiCuFxBIpulA0lvfbGyjqQIKFhZpZtajBZJBA).

- **Important:** If you have not assigned groups to each instructor and teaching assistant (TA), you'll want to do that today because today we start hosting standups for student groups.

  - The instructional staff should check in with each group to find out what they accomplished since the last class. 
    - Make sure TAs inform you if a certain group is behind.
    - If a group is found to be behind schedule, assign a TA to actively workshop with that group to get the group back on track.

  - Remind students to reference the Group Project 1 guidelines:  [05-07-Group-Project-1/02-Activities/05.1-Group-Project-1-Guidelines Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y)

- **"Conflicting" feedback:** Students will often report anxiety around the feedback they receive from the instructional staff. 

    - Ease students' concerns by telling them that each instructor and each person will have a different perspective, and this diversity of opinion is a good thing. As a UX designer in the workplace, it is your job to take feedback from many stakeholders and use that to mold your solutions.

- **Put on your coach hat:** Students may not finish all of their deliverables on schedule. That is OK. Sometimes groups fall behind in the process. As an instructor, it's time to put on your coaching hat and use your best coaching skills to encourage students to execute. Provide positive feedback and let them know they're doing great work. Use constructive suggestions so that they feel they are on track for success.

- **Help students get unstuck:** Students have sometimes reported that when interviewing, they found that their idea was not a problem for the people interviewed. This IS NOT WRONG. Tell the students this is great work. They have learned what NOT TO DO. Their goal should be to mine that data through synthesis methods to identify a pain point for which they can design a solution.

- **Remember:** Instructors and TAs should not be idle at their computers. You all should be engaging with student groups throughout the entire day.

- At your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.

  > globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Use breakout rooms for the student groups. Be sure you are actively moving between the groups with the TAs to keep students moving forward and the energy high.

  - In these workshops, you and the TAs will rotate between student groups to provide help on specific tasks. These workshops should be between 10 and 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.
  
  - This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom and establish breakout rooms for working with individual groups. Be creative here!

- **Using Zoom:** It takes time to become proficient using Zoom, the primary online instructional tool. Please refer to the following guide for help performing essential online teaching tasks (sharing screens, managing breakout rooms, etc.): [Zoom Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MtogY4tO4aMPgQ0mlHpdtvi8rmkt9efN__mBngs9tg/edit).

- If needed, review [Strategies for Class Online](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/ux-ui-curriculum-version2/tree/master/01-lesson-plans/05-Week#strategies-for-class-online).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Objectives (5 min)

### Welcome the students to class.

- Launch the lecture slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/05.3-Group Project One, Day Two Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h-tXUSEiCuFxBIpulA0lvfbGyjqQIKFhZpZtajBZJBA).

- First, review the Group Project 1 timeline.

  - We are in our second day of Week 1.

  - Remind students to be proactive, as group projects can quickly get behind if group members are not using class time effectively or waiting until the last minute to get their work done.

### Students will be applying the stages of the design thinking process.

- > **Say:** "You are going to be repeating the design thinking double diamond process with Group Project 1."
  - Group Project 1 weeks are designed to allow students to practice what they have learned and execute the design thinking process at a higher quality.

  - Group Project 1 deliverables and activities are repeated from the previous four weeks.

  - If students need refreshers for what to work on, have them return to their slide deck and activity resources already shared.

- Finally, walk through today's learning objectives. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take any questions students have about how today will work.

Next, move on to your only lecture of the day, on project management.

## 2. Instructor Do: Product Managers and Agile Product Management (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to overview the role of project management in any UX/UI process. 

As teams working on a group project together, you want to hold each other accountable through evenly distributing the workload, sharing in completing design thinking deliverables, and providing feedback to your team. 

- Why? In the "real world," UX designers might work with product managers or even take on that role themselves.

> **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, you will very likely join an Agile software team and your ability to work inside design sprints with the principles of agile project management are key skills that are relevant to the industry. Your ability to speak to your experience in delivering work during design sprints along with managing work cadence and processes will make you more employable.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: This section is heavy on in-class discussion. When asking questions, stop sharing your screen and switch to Zoom gallery view as students offer their answers. Begin sharing your screen again once students have finished suggesting answers.

Ask: **What is a product manager?**

Product managers are responsible for guiding the success of a product. They lead cross-functional teams and are responsible for defining the why, when, and what of the product that the engineering team builds.

Product managers:

- Provide deep product expertise needed to lead the organization and make strategic product decisions.

- Are responsible for setting a product vision and strategy.

- Own the creative process of generating, developing, and curating new ideas.

- Prioritize features by ranking them against strategic goals and initiatives.

- Plan what their teams will deliver and the timeline for implementation.

Product managers and UX designers share many core competencies, such as key performance indicator (KPI) monitoring, managing a backlog of tasks, user research, usability testing, and prototyping.

- **TAs,** Slack out:
  - [What Makes a Great Product Manager](https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager)
  - [What Does a Product Manager Do Each Day?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dczveSrsv8&feature=youtu.be)
  - [Product Management and UX](https://medium.com/@uxpodcast/product-management-ux-with-melissa-perri-6bdb2a17a3e5)
  - [Product Management vs. UX](https://medium.com/@melissaperri/labeling-ourselves-17218fd4456f)

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** If you or one of the TAs have worked in a project manager role, briefly share what your key responsibilities were. 

> **Say:** Remember our project requirements document? A product manager's job is to create user stories and scoping requirements.

> **Ask:** "Has anyone ever been involved in a SCRUM or a daily standup in your current job?" 

- Call on a student and let them answer quickly.

### Discuss Scrum Method & Daily Standups:

Scrum is the most popular agile framework in software development. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called Sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. 

- The Scrum Team tracks progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums or standups. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review or sprint retrospective to demonstrate the work done and what has been continuously improved.

- It is an iterative approach that has at its core the sprint—the scrum term for iteration.

- Scrum standups are designed to allow a team to maximize work time. We will be practicing scrum throughout our group projects. 

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions about the PM role and share your experience with agile product management.

### Discuss Sprints:

The scrum approach includes assembling the project’s requirements and using them to define the project. A sprint is one time-boxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a sprint, the team's planned amount of work has to be completed and made ready for review. 

- Next, plan the necessary sprints and divide each sprint into its own list of requirements.

Daily standup as part of scrum:

- Daily Scrum standups help keep the project on target. For software teams, a standup is like a sports team’s huddle or a scrum from rugby.

Teams use Scrum standups to answer three key questions:

- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions about the concept of "agile" project management. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share your experience of getting used to daily stand-ups. Ask a TA to briefly share as well. 

> **Instructor Note:** We're going to hold standups at the beginning of group project weeks.

- To practice for the "real world," we do standups as teams. Project managers/scrum masters will typically run standups to ensure that team members are executing their deliverables and contributing as a team toward completing the project.

- Practice for yourselves. Each group STAND UP!

> **Instructor Note:** Take any questions that remain.

Next, students are going to learn by doing as they perform a standup meeting with their groups.

## 3. Student Do: Daily Standup Activity (10 min)

> **Instructor Note:** We recommend demoing a standup quickly with your TAs to model behavior. Use the Standup method below.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Put student groups into breakout rooms for this activity and their following working sessions. Pre-build Zoom breakout rooms to match your groups. Keep one group in the main room to preserve the class video. The group who signs up for check-in slot one will remain.

- With your TAs, visit the groups in their standup session.
- Reinforce the use of the standup language. For example:
    - **Yesterday:** What did you do last class? 
    - **Today:** What are you working on today?
    - **Blockers:** Are you missing any information from a team member that is keeping you from accomplishing your task? i.e., Jane Jett was supposed to share the user persona with me, but it was incomplete. I am blocked on sourcing interviews until she completes her deliverable. (Jane and the blocked designer could collaborate at this point to get unblocked.)

**Instructions:**

- First, move the groups into breakout rooms. 
  - Divide students equally between the instructional staff so that you have one TA per group, and one for yourself.

- Each group should answer the following questions:
  - What did I work on yesterday?
  - What am I working on today?
  - What issues are blocking me?

- Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind or have blockers.

  - Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

Now that your groups all know what you're planning to work on today, get to it!

## 4. Student Do: Work Session 1 (70 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to work with each group throughout the working sessions to give feedback on their deliverables process and give suggestions.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Keep the groups in their breakout rooms to get started on making progress on the day. With your TAs have groups use the sign-up sheet for check-ins. Move between groups offering support, reviewing deliverables, and asking lots of questions.

![Overview](Images/slide1.png)

- Groups should work diligently. With your TAs, sit with individual teams whose members look idle or don't have a task.

> **Instructor Note:** The goal is to check in with every team. If you and the TAs are assigned to groups, communicate about their progress so that they stay on track.

## 5. Break (15 min) 

Big break time! 

Brain breaks are an important part of the learning process, so take a break! Get up from your screen and relax, have a bite to eat, and drink some water.

> **Instructor Note:** Breaks during group project week can be more informal. If teams want to keep working, don't interrupt their flow. We recommend that you and the TAs schedule a moment to get up and walk around as students can and will book up your entire day in the group check-in spreadsheet.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Don't stop sharing your screen! Put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual timer will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time. Use Slack @here to let groups know it is a good time to take a break. 

## 6. Student Do: Work Session 2 (80 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to make progress on the group project. Refer to group project requirements to keep groups on task.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Return students to their breakout rooms if they left for break.

- Groups should work diligently. With your TAs, visit individual teams whose members look idle or don't have a task and use the sign-up check-in sheet 

  - [Group Check-in Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vjm_8BNEoxJIz1RAYGtpPVf8gafrAWbxEjMHeitWe9Q/edit?usp=sharing)

- Ways to support students as they work:
  - Ask questions. What do they know? What do they want to know? What's next?
  - Have groups walk you through their process. Teams should be analyzing interview data if they don't have qualitative data to help get them on the right path.
  - Workshop with groups, helping review their completed requirements and pulling out things they should dive deeper on.

Again, if a group seems to be falling behind, have a TA focus on helping that group get caught up. 

> **Instructor Note:** By the end of class, every group should have meet with you.

## 7. Instructor Do: Work Session 2 Review (5 min)

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Stop sharing your screen and switch to Zoom gallery view as students offer their answers. Share your screen to reveal the answer to each question. Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Begin the review by taking questions from students. If you need to stimulate discussion, ask:
  - What was a struggle for you this time?
  - What worked well this time?

> **Instructor Note:** Take any final questions.

At this point, it's time to end class.

## 8. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)

> **Instructor Note:** **Before the next class, students need to ensure they've completed all of Day 2's Group Project 1 Requirements:** [https://drive.google.com/open?id=10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y). 

  - If students have not finished all of the requirements, encourage them to stick around for office hours and to prioritize the missing pieces.

- ***Recap the progress teams made during class:***

1. Conduct five user interviews.
2. Complete four interview transcripts.
3. Analyze data by creating one affinity diagram.
4. Synthesize data into a user persona *or* empathy map.
5. Receive constructive feedback on your persona or empathy map from at least one instructor.
6. Define one user insight.

### Recap the project management concepts to reinforce learning:

- What is project management?
  - *Answer: Product managers are responsible for guiding the success of a product. They lead cross-functional teams and are responsible for defining the why, when, and what of the product that the engineering team builds.*
- What is the key goal of the project manager role?
  - *Answer: To keep the process moving and team members delivering on their task.*
