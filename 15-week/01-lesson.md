# 15.1 Lesson Plan: Group Project 2 Presentation Prep

---

## Overview

Today's class lets student groups wrap up and polish their Group Project 2 deliverables and prepare their presentations for the next class. Students are in the third week of research, design, and usability testing on their user interface (UI) high-fidelity prototypes. Teams should polish their solutions and prepare to present their work.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Write a case study outline for their Group Project 2 presentations.

2. Build a UI case study in Google Slides.

3. Prepare for group presentations.

4. Practice presentation slides and UI prototype demo.

5. Establish presentation order.

## Class at a Glance

- Today, students will work on presentations and document their group's UI design process during Group Project 2.

  - During the first part of the day, students will complete a presentation case study outline.

  - Students will spend the rest of the day building out their presentation case study in Google Slides.

### Presentation Order

- By the end of class or before the next class, establish a group presentation order.

- As the instructor, you can choose how to establish the presentation order.
- Some recommendations:

   1. Create a presentation order for your cohort and share with students via Slack.
   2. Presentation by Group name, alphabetical (a-z or z-a).
   3. Allow teams to self-select order.

- **Every group must present, and all presentations are due at the start of 15.2.**

## Prepare for Class

- Review lecture slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/15.1 Group Project 2 Presentation Prep Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYAhmGMOpMFy-kqUpStHRyXPpe0O5e8g5EMs1-ZsX6A/edit?usp=sharing).

- Presentations are highly collaborative and require practice. Encourage students to use the final in-class session work time to get their teams aligned and PRACTICE! PRACTICE! PRACTICE!

- **All group presentations are due by the next class, Presentations Day 1.**

> To make it fair for all groups regardless of the presentation day, all groups must submit their presentations together.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (5 min)

Welcome students to class and open the slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/15.1 Group Project 2 Presentation Prep Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYAhmGMOpMFy-kqUpStHRyXPpe0O5e8g5EMs1-ZsX6A/edit?usp=sharing).

Create a .pdf of the slides and Slack out to students.

### Review today's requirements
Quickly review today goals before jumping into group work.

## 2. Instructor Do: Group Project 2 Presentation Requirements (5 min)

### Group Project 2 presentations:

Each presentation will last about 10 minutes.
- Each group will receive 5 to 10 minutes of constructive feedback.

### Presentation requirements:

Presentations should be in Google Slides. Prototypes should be built in Adobe XD or InVision.
- A presentation should have 10 to 15 slides, last no more than 15 minutes, and contain no font smaller than 18 points.

### Make sure to:

- Set up the problem.
- State the value proposition or problem statement.
- Define the user persona (including goals, needs, potential gains/opportunities).
- Cite user research.
- Illustrate the user journey/storyboards.
- Outline user testing.
- Describe iterations based on problems encountered.
- Present final InVision prototype (mobile).

> **Instructor Note:** Each group member should present an equal share, or roughly one-third, of the presentation.

### Presentation strategies:

Behind every presentation is a story. Once you know the story that you want to tell, the design of the presentation should support the message.

### Practice, practice, practice.
If you wing it, we will know.

### Use a simple image as a background:

- The presentation starts by highlighting the product’s mission. It's a good starting point.
- Blurring the background is helpful if you want to put text over the image.
- If the background is blurred, use an image that reinforces the text.

### Let the user do the talking:

- Using the words of your customers has a real impact on a project team because no one can argue with how a customer feels.
- The customers' or users' words remind everyone that the user is the center of this story.

### Highlight key themes with diagrams:

- A diagram can be more efficient than trying to describe something in words.
- This diagram illustrates how diagrams can help reinforce a concept using words differently.

### Expose your design process:

- Don’t be afraid to put your raw sketches out there for the project team to see.
- When storytelling, one of the designer’s most powerful contributions is the design process.
- Exposing the design process brings your audience on the journey of how your thoughts develop.
- When presenting to people, common questions include:
  - How did you come up with this?
  - Why did you decide to do it this way?
- It’s a good idea to include at least one slide that provides some context on how you arrived at your design. That can include any deliverables that might help support your narrative and design conclusion.

### Put your design front and center:

- After providing some context on the design process and demonstrating how the design was arrived at, introduce the proposed design.
- Every time you showcase design, make sure it’s the focus.
- Your audience will likely have questions, and thus you should be prepared to discuss the design.

### Most important, tell a story and remember to:

- Keep your slides very simple so the audience will listen to you and not be distracted by the text.

- Keep the audience engaged as much as possible.

## 3. Instructor Do: Presentation Tips and Strategies (15 min)

1. Tell a story as a group.

   - Stories are much more interesting than facts because stories entertain us. Storytelling grabs and maintains audience attention.

2. Ask questions at crucial moments.

   - A question breaks up your regular presentation rhythm and helps to reinforce that what you’re saying is important.

3. Don’t read off of slides.

   - Reading directly from a slide that everyone in the room can see (and read for themselves) is boring and makes you look unprepared.

4. Highlight important points with visual metaphors.

   - Visual images of scenarios the audience is already familiar with help retain points longer in our memory.

5. Organize your presentation into three main points or takeaways.

6. Share the responsibility.

   - You are a team, and each team member needs to demonstrate their contributions. Use an MC, and make sure to introduce yourself.

7. Consider your audience and use a pitch mindset.

   - The audience doesn't know you and they are seeing this presentation for the first time. Consider what the audience is curious about.

## 4. Instructor Do: Review UI Design Portfolios (5 min)

Group projects are about creating work that students can highlight in their portfolios. The goal is to review the value of UI in their portfolio. We also want to show students some samples from others that do this in the "real world."

- Hiring managers and UX/UI teams care about process.

- Hiring managers want to understand how you solve problems pertaining to the following:
  - User research, research reports, sketches, wireframes, user flows, wireflows, user stories, customer journey maps, prototypes, user testing, and the final product

- UI case studies should be easy to consume. Consider a one-pager.

  - Encourage students to review some sample case studies:

  - [https://www.casestudy.club/category/interface](https://www.casestudy.club/category/interface)

   - [https://www.bestfolios.com/home](https://www.bestfolios.com/home)

- Review what great UI case studies cover.

## 5. Student Do: Project 2 Case Study Outline Activity (25 min)

In this activity, you will create a case study outline for your mobile application homework.

**TAs:** Slack out the template: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GBcwzYYT3kpyiCZX3HFFBPlQhq0T4Fn9TcxAcAHafyU](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GBcwzYYT3kpyiCZX3HFFBPlQhq0T4Fn9TcxAcAHafyU).

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Instructor and TAs should move between group breakout rooms use Slack to communicate with groups. We recommend using more scheduling with groups to make sure the instructional staff is not too disruptive to the groups working flow. Don't allow groups to not touch base online collaboration is harder and will require more accountability.

## 6. Student Do: Peer Review (20 min)

Call the class back to attention, and have students conduct a peer review.

## 7. Instructor Do: Review Outlines (2 min)

Call the class back to attention.

## 8. Student Do: Google Slide Presentation Prep (30 min)

## 9. Break (15 min)

Breaks can happen whenever. Make certain that groups come back after the break.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Don't stop sharing your screen. If you want put up a google timer or a youtube timer video it can help get students back into the zoom room on time.

## 10. Student Do: Google Slide Presentation Prep (55 min)

Continue working on your Google Slide presentation.

- Encourage practicing your presentation as a team.
