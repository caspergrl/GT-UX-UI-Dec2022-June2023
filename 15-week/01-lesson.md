# 15.1 Lesson Plan: Group Project 2 Presentation Prep

---

## Overview

Today's class lets student groups wrap up and polish their Group Project 2 deliverables and prepare their presentations for the next class. Students are in the third week of research, design, and usability testing on their user interface (UI) high-fidelity prototypes. Teams should polish their solutions and prepare to present their work.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Write a case study outline for their Group Project 2 presentations.

2. Build a UI case study in Google Slides.

3. Prepare for group presentations.

4. Practice presentation slides and UI prototype demo.

5. Establish presentation order.

## Class at a Glance

- Today, students will work on presentations and document their group's UI design process during Group Project 2.

  - During the first part of the day, students will complete a presentation case study outline.

  - Students will spend the rest of the day building out their presentation case study in Google Slides.

### Presentation Order

- By the end of class or before the next class, establish a group presentation order.

- As the instructor, you can choose how to establish the presentation order.
- Some recommendations:

   1. Create a presentation order for your cohort and share with students via Slack.
   2. Presentation by Group name, alphabetical (a-z or z-a).
   3. Allow teams to self-select order.

- **Every group must present, and all presentations are due at the start of 15.2.**

## Prepare for Class

- Review lecture slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/15.1 Group Project 2 Presentation Prep Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYAhmGMOpMFy-kqUpStHRyXPpe0O5e8g5EMs1-ZsX6A/edit?usp=sharing).

- Presentations are highly collaborative and require practice. Encourage students to use the final in-class session work time to get their teams aligned and PRACTICE! PRACTICE! PRACTICE!

- **All group presentations are due by the next class, Presentations Day 1.**

> To make it fair for all groups regardless of the presentation day, all groups must submit their presentations together.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have the teaching assistants (TAs) consult the [13-15-Group-Project-2/04-Time Trackers/15.1-Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17N9UbizgaPpP36RGXEATeBxx47Iul5ubda3jAaP0IwY/edit?usp=sharing).

## SLIDE 15
Presentations can go wrong from designers:
- Using UX jargon to non-uxers
- Not visualizing the process from wireframes to design compositions
- Not validating ideas before presenting them
- Making presentations too short or too long
- Forgetting to practice and thinking they can "wing it"

## SLIDE 16
Additional presentation tips:   
- We frequently have to present our work to communicate what we've done previously
- We need to consider how our presentations must change for our audience
- We have to also present to show our design thinking process.
- We need to convey that we are self-initiating and driven to find the answers we need.

## SLIDE 17
Practice, practice, practice!

Review tips

## SLIDE 19
Use a clear, simple image as a background.
- The presentation starts by highlighting the product’s mission. It's a good starting point.
- Blurring the background is helpful if you want to put text over the image.
- If the background is blurred, use an 
image that reinforces the text.

## SLIDE 20
### Highlight key themes with diagrams:

- A diagram can be more efficient than trying to describe something in words.
- This diagram illustrates how diagrams can help reinforce a concept using words differently.

## SLIDE 21
### Expose your design process:

- Don’t be afraid to put your raw sketches out there for the project team to see.
- When storytelling, one of the designer’s most powerful contributions is the design process.
- Exposing the design process brings your audience on the journey of how your thoughts develop.
- When presenting to people, common questions include:
  - How did you come up with this?
  - Why did you decide to do it this way?
- It’s a good idea to include at least one slide that provides some context on how you arrived at your design. That can include any deliverables that might help support your narrative and design conclusion.

## SLIDE 22
### Put your design front and center:

- After providing some context on the design process and demonstrating how the design was arrived at, introduce the proposed design.
- Every time you showcase design, make sure it’s the focus.
- Your audience will likely have questions, and thus you should be prepared to discuss the design.

## SLIDE 23
- Consider your audience
- Ask questions at crucial moments
- Don't read directly off the slides
- Highlight important points with visual metaphors
- Organize your presentation by main points or takeaways
- Share the responsibilty

## 8. Student Do: Google Slide Presentation Prep (30 min)

It is time to begin creating your Google Slide presentation.

**TAs:** Slack out the template: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fDPsD_5KaVnogLi-UWOzCPSnXieikmRq8klO1lMxw7g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fDPsD_5KaVnogLi-UWOzCPSnXieikmRq8klO1lMxw7g/edit?usp=sharing).

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Instructor and TAs should move between group breakout rooms use Slack to communicate with groups. We recommend using more scheduling with groups to make sure the instructional staff is not too disruptive to the groups working flow. Don't allow groups to not touch base online collaboration is harder and will require more accountability.

## 9. Break (15 min)

Breaks can happen whenever. Make certain that groups come back after the break.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Don't stop sharing your screen. If you want put up a google timer or a youtube timer video it can help get students back into the zoom room on time.

## 10. Student Do: Google Slide Presentation Prep (55 min)

Continue working on your Google Slide presentation.

- Encourage practicing your presentation as a team.
