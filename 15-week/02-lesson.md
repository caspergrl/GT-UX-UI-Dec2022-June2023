# 15.2 Lesson Plan: Group Project 2 Nonprofit UI Prototype Presentations, Day 1

---

## Overview

Today, students will present their group projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Practice presenting information to an audience.
2. Provide constructive feedback to their peers.

## Class at a Glance

- Today's class is all about student presentations.

> It is recommended that you invite any industry friends or guests to the class presentations. Student groups have worked very hard, and their presentations are a fun way to show off to outside participants. Presenting work also helps students to network.

## Prepare for Class

- Review lecture slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/15.2 Group Project 2 Presentations Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TwqrXP2F9ExeAvSexOblUL6qPwOQJVRTMwCuT16DOBw/edit?usp=sharing).

- Students will be nervous. It is important to set a supportive tone by instructing the class to clap before a group starts its presentation and after it ends.

- Arrive early to class so that you can configure the room appropriately for presentations, including Panopto, microphones, and any other necessary equipment.

- Students should present using your laptop so that we can use Panopto to record the presentation session.

- Remind all students to share their Google Slide project presentations via a link in Slack.

  - Today moves quickly. Get presentation teams in the order for the day and move onto the first presentation quickly.

- Periodically, check to verify Panopto is still recording between different groups.

- When a presentation is complete, students will answer open-floor questions from you, the teaching assistants (TAs), and classmates for 5 to 10 minutes. Providing clear feedback is critical for your students, so make sure you follow the advice in this plan.

- This class is about setting students up for success during the rest of the course. We want students to grasp the importance of storytelling regarding sharing work. We want them to internalize the case study process.

## Sample Student Presentations

After students have presented their projects, take some time to submit their work to the form below. This will assist future instructional staff.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [13-15-Group-Project-2/04-Time Trackers/15.2-Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kHaZT6MAtamGzAI-fOdRluzS7XQZPqHI-lB6Rw3Ro_w/edit#gid=746489284).

## Strategies for Presentations Online

- The original class materials were not designed for an online class, so there might be some gaps in the instructional materials and the student experience. We know this transition is an inconvenience and that it requires significant preparation and learning from you.

Online presentation strategies:

1. Place everyone except the presenting team on mute.

2. Disable the Zoom chat and tell everyone to quit Slack.

3. Shorten the intro as much as possible to maximize presentation time.

### Office Hours: (45 mins before class) (Office Hours)

Encourage students to come early and utilize the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (5 min)

Welcome students to class and open the slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/15.2 Group Project 2 Presentations Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TwqrXP2F9ExeAvSexOblUL6qPwOQJVRTMwCuT16DOBw/edit?usp=sharing).

- If you have industry guests, provide short introductions.

## 2. Instructor Do: Assign Homework (5 min)

Have TAs Slack out the Unit 15 homework instructions: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1csrch5GndiOg0iSLjFAFqb4vbaGOq4Imq_dG0Jmzvjs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1csrch5GndiOg0iSLjFAFqb4vbaGOq4Imq_dG0Jmzvjs)

Open the homework instructions and review them with students.

## 3. Student Do: Student Presentations, Part 1 (80 min)

Congratulate your class on developing their projects to a state worth presenting. Assure them that they should take pride in what they've accomplished over a mere 15 weeks of user experience (UX)/user interface (UI) training!

**Instructions:**

- Go down the list and send each group to the front of the class.

- Give students roughly two minutes to set up.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Instructors make sure all students videos are on and everyone is muted.

- When a group nears the 10-minute mark, motion for them to draw their presentation to a close (like pointing to your watch/imaginary watch).

- Don't say anything during the presentation. You don't want your voice to interrupt their talk, especially since you're recording them.

- Follow each of the presentations with 5 to 10 minutes of questions about their projects.

- Let TAs and classmates ask questions, too.

- When the Q&A session concludes, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.

- When a group finishes after 8 p.m., announce a break.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Limit the QA sessions to give students groups a good review.
