# 23.3 Lesson Plan: Final Group Project 3, Day 6

## Please take the End-of-Course Instructor Survey (please complete before the last day of class if you have not done so already).

Trilogy, as a company, values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It is hard for us to know what these areas are unless we're asking questions.

Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are key members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we would appreciate your sharing feedback at the following link:

## Overview

- In this class, students will continue working on their Final Group Project 3 of the UX/UI Boot Camp.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Practice a daily scrum stand-up.
2. Make iterations to their UX/UI prototypes.
3. Create polished high-fidelity UI FE Dev prototypes.
4. Iterate UI/FE dev prototypes.
5. Conduct more UI usability testing.

## Class at a Glance

- More project work! The instructor and teaching assistants (TAs) should rotate among groups helping in whatever ways they can.

## Prepare for Class

- Today, at your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.- In these workshops, student groups will rotate among the instructor and TAs for help on specific topics, such as refining ideas, finding the user need, ideating (e.g., what if/I like/I wish), empathizing with users (e.g., proto-personas), and so forth.

- These workshops should be 10 to 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

> **Instructor Note:** This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom to a small space to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

- You will once again use the "small group" workshop format, if possible, so more adept groups can concentrate on their projects while you give additional attention to students who might be struggling.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [22-24-Final-Project/03-TimeTrackers/23.3-Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgA3XGevRxGYQ06pgu1Gl17qnbqkj1l3hnWGsRBmedE/edit?usp=sharing).

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Office Hours: (45 mins before class) (Office Hours)

Encourage students to come early and utilize the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by standing up and walking around to engage students who come early and participate in office hours.

## 1. Instructor Do: Final Group Project 3, Day 6 Introduction (5 min)

ðŸ“Œ Today is the last day of their second week of the project. Teams should be far along and rapidly iterating their coded FE solutions. Today is about testing and iteration, so they can polish off their project next week for completing the UX/UI Boot Camp.

- Launch today's slides: [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/23.3 Final Project Day 6 slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ldErrMbyUj86gmssr2hY1HrVzutqDjwsimXDj6oMNPo).

- Welcome students to the class, then immediately allow them to work on their projects.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Prebuild Zoom breakout rooms and get students into their working spaces. Use with TAs use Slack to communicate with which group Zoom breakout room you will be joining for review and help.

- Instructors/TAs offer help when possible.

  - Students should be at a place for completing their projects and working on their presentations.

  - Suggest deliverables that all team members should have completed: user personas, problem statements, user funnels, user journeys, InVision or Adobe XD prototypes, RWD style guides, FE webpages (one to three), and project presentation case studies.

## 2. Student Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up (10 min)

**Instructions:**

1. Split the teams up equally among the instructional staff.

2. Each group member should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.

   - Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

## 3. Instructor Do: Daily Scrum Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention and review any common themes you saw with the class.

## 4. Students Do: Working Session 1 (70 min)

ðŸ“Œ Student teams should be actively building and testing their deliverables and moving toward shareable prototypes.

- Groups keep working on their projects.

- Student teams are getting into the groove with their projects, so allow them to keep working. Don't just sit and watch; workshop with each team to give feedback and help teams iterate quickly.

- Instructors/TAs offer help when possible.

## 5. Break (15 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Breaks are entirely optional for student groups during project working days but the instructional staff should take a break.

- Say, **"Let's take a break before we get into the next working session."**

---

## 6. Student Do: Working Session 2 (60 min)

ðŸ“Œ Student teams should be actively be testing their shareable prototypes.

- Students should continue working on projects.

## 7. Instructor Do: Review (10 min)

- Review any overarching questions and offer closing thoughts.

## 8. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)

- Say: **"We did a lot today, but as a UX/FE dev, you should be iterating, and your team should have high-fidelity prototypes!"**
