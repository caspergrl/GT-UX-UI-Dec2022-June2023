# 23.1 Lesson Plan: Final Group Project 3, Day 4

## Please take the End-of-Course Instructor Survey (please complete before the last day of class).

Trilogy, as a company, values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It is hard for us to know what these areas are unless we're asking questions.

Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are key members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we'd appreciate your sharing feedback at the following link:

## Overview

In this class, students will continue working on their Final Group Project 3 of the UX/UI Boot Camp.

## Learning Objectives

Each team will workshop these deliverables by the end of class:

1. Iterate their UX scenario and user flow diagrams to improve UI prototypes.

2. Iterate their low-fidelity prototype via usability testing (InVision or Adobe XD prototype).

3. Code a Bootstrap 4 prototype for a minimum of three webpages.

4. Execute UI inspiration and new UI brand directions (color palette, Typography, etc.).

5. Design a FE UI style tile (UI Style Guide 1.0).

## Class at a Glance

- Remind students of the goals and requirements of Final Group Project 3.


- The schedule for the Final Group Project 3 follows:

  - Day 4 (Today):

    - Students are given all of the class to work on their projects.
    - The instructor and TAs work closely with groups to offer "UX/human-need assistance."

  - Day 5:

    - Students are given all of the class to work on their projects.
    - The instructor and TAs work closely with groups to offer "UX/human-need assistance."

  - Day 6:

    - Students are given all of the class to work on their projects.

  - Day 7 (final week):

    - Students work on their projects.
    - Students begin planning their final presentations.

  - Day 8 (Presentations 1):

    - Students present their final projects!

  - Day 9 (Presentations 2 and Graduation):

    - Students present their final projects and graduate!

- Today, at your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.
- In these workshops, student groups will rotate among the instructor and TAs for help on specific topics, such as refining ideas, finding the user need, ideating (e.g., what if/I like/I wish), empathizing with users (e.g., proto-personas), and so forth.
    - These workshops should be 10 to 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.
        - Note: This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom to a small space to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [22-24-Final-Porject/03-TimeTrackers/23.1 Time Tracker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sPvb9z1pVA3WHqsi8jZb6NJLed8_kB9BY_wpLB_jc8I).

- If your class is on a Saturday schedule, use the flex time for extending lectures, activities, or review sessions. 

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Today's Objectives (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Teams should be far along and rapidly iterating their solutions. Today is about testing and iteration, so groups can refine their projects.

- Launch today's slides: [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/23.1 Final Project Day 4 slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19XDlJI2Y_aq8NCflbNGWEGp635yXyDA_FosYH7Ij_Z8).

  - Export a PDF and share slides with the class via Slack.

- Welcome students to class, then immediately allow them to work on their projects.

  - Instructors/TAs offer help when possible.

  - Students should be at a rudimentary place for starting user scenarios, user flows, sketches, and some basic HTML/CSS.

  - Suggest deliverables that all team members should have completed: personas, problem statements, user funnels, user journeys. etc.

## 2. Student Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up (10 min)

**Instructions:**

1. Split the teams up equally among the instructional staff.

2. Each group member should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.

   - Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

## 3. Instructor Do: Daily Scrum Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention and review any common themes you saw with the class.

## 4. Student Do: Working Session 1 (70 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Student teams are getting into the groove with their projects, so allow them to keep working. Don't just sit and watch; workshop with each team to give feedback and help teams iterate quickly.

- Groups keep working on their projects.

- Instructors/TAs offer help when possible.

## 5. Break (15 min on weekdays/45 min on Saturday)

- Say, **"Let's take a break before we get into the next working session."**

## 6. Student Do: Working Session 2 (60 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Student teams should be actively building and testing their deliverables and moving toward shareable prototypes.

- Students should continue working on projects.

- Groups should be working on coding a Bootstrap 4 prototype for a minimum of three webpages.

## 7. Instructor Do: Review (10 min)

- Review any overarching questions and offer closing thoughts.

## 8. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)
