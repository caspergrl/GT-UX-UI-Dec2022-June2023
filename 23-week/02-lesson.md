## Please take the End-of-Course Instructor Survey (please complete before the last day of class if you have not done so already).

Trilogy, as a company, values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It is hard for us to know what these areas are unless we're asking questions.

Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are key members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we would appreciate your sharing feedback at the following link:

## Overview

- In this class, students will continue working on their Final Group Project 3 of the UX/UI Boot Camp.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Practice a daily scrum stand-up.
2. Build a clickable prototype in InVision or Adobe XD.
3. Write a usability testing plan.
4. Conduct at least three user tests.
5. Analyze usability testing data.

## Class at a Glance

- Students should continue working on their projects.

- Students should be introduced to the concept of planning a project and building a visual plan.

## Prepare for Class

- Today's class is about giving students plenty of time to work on their Final Project 3 prototypes.

- **Review the slides for the lecture:** [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/23.2 Final Project Day 5 slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yDYJk94kZCkptYPEqrhlG-3IBhjTEEK_Ic5CUr0YKsY).

- Make a PDF copy of the Google slides to share with students and teaching assistants (TAs) via Slack. Feel free to modify the slides slightly to fit your style, but be sure to cover the same concepts and activities.

- As the instructor and TAs, keep in mind that the success of your students after boot camp is largely dictated by the quality of the projects in their portfolios. Encourage your students to do their best work and steer them toward producing high-quality final projects!

-Today, at your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.- In these workshops, student groups will rotate among the instructor and TAs for help on specific topics, such as refining ideas, finding the user need, ideating (e.g., what if/I like/I wish), empathizing with users (e.g., proto-personas), and so forth.

- These workshops should be 10 to 20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

- You will once again use the "small group" workshop format, if possible, so more adept groups can concentrate on their projects while you give additional attention to students who might be struggling.

> **Instructor Note:** This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom to a small space to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [22-24-Final-Project/03-TimeTrackers/23.2 TimeTracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1alS9Gdf0qicVPiTYE3W0vt3uanBW66ZHeB8so3CPKtQ/edit?usp=sharing).

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Office Hours: (45 mins before class) (Office Hours)

Encourage students to come early and utilize the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Today's Objectives (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Teams should be far along in their projects and rapidly iterating their solutions. Today is dedicated to testing and iteration, so groups can refine their projects.

- Launch today's slides: [22-24-Final-Project/01-Slides/23.2 Final Project Day 5 slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yDYJk94kZCkptYPEqrhlG-3IBhjTEEK_Ic5CUr0YKsY).

  - Export a PDF and share slides with the class via Slack.

- Review the agenda for today.

## 2. Student Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up (10 min)

**Instructions:**

1. Split the teams up equally among the instructional staff.

2. Each group member should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.

   - Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

## 3. Instructor Do: Daily Scrum Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention and review any common themes you saw with the class.

## 4. Student Do: Working Session 1 (70 min)

ðŸ“Œ Student teams are getting into the groove with their projects, so allow them to keep working. Don't just sit and watch; workshop with each team to give feedback and help teams iterate quickly.

- Instructors: Begin pulling out small groups of students for review.

- TAs: During this time, work with groups as "one of the team members" in 20-minute sessions per group. Essentially, serve as Senior UX designers floating among teams.

## 5. Break (15 min) 

- Say, **"Let's take a break before we get into the next working session."**


## 6. Student Do: Working Session 2 (60 min)

ðŸ“Œ Student teams should be actively building and testing their deliverables and moving toward shareable prototypes.
