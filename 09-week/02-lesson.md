# 9.2 Lesson Plan: UI Design Systems, Card Sorting, Sitemaps, and UI System Navigation

---

## Overview

In today's class, students will learn about UI design systems, card sorting, sitemaps, and navigation. You'll be walking students through a card sorting exercise, reviewing how to structure information logically, and discussing how to apply card sorting to information architecture (IA) and navigation schemes.

Last class (Lesson 9.1), you covered the fundamentals of effective IA, which is essential to successful web design. Today's class focuses on UI design systems, card sorting, and navigation. Next class (Lesson 9.3), you'll cover the fundamentals of UI design branding: UI style guides, brand positioning statements, brand voice, and iconography. Unit 9 enables students to jump into creating higher fidelity UI prototypes of website navigation that can be validated by users and fellow group members as well as stylized with color, type, and visual design decisions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Articulate the IA of a site using card sorting.
2. Perform open card sorting with a team to create a new navigation structure for a site.
3. Create a sitemap that defines primary, secondary, and tertiary page distinctions.
4. Identify and organize content into a navigation scheme in Figma/Adobe XD.
5. Sketch and design a new UI navigation solution in Figma/Adobe XD based on a sitemap.

## Class at a Glance

- Welcome to Lesson 9.2 on UI design systems, sitemaps, and navigation. In this lesson, you'll teach card sorting and sitemapping, and then prepare students to design UI navigation for a site.
- Today's class is divided into three parts:
  - Part 1 will introduce IA and card sorting.
  - Part 2 will cover website sitemapping.
  - Part 3 will teach UI navigation.
- By the end of today's class, students will understand how to visualize into a UI. They'll draw on their card sorting and site-mapping activities to begin designing unique UI navigation solutions for a desktop site.

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: 🌐) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activities and reviews by doing the activities together as a class instead of creating breakout groups. 

## Preparing for Class

- Review slides for the lecture: [09-Week/01-slides/09.2 UI Systems and Sitemaps Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VkQegV0RidCIetQqHvlYYAQ_OBXnMwmsK_qzc16pfWs).
- Be sure to read through the entire lesson plan, slides, student activity files, as well as the Time Tracker—and make notes so that you’re thoroughly prepared to teach and support students.
- Keep in mind that Unit 9 is a very demanding week and covers a large volume of content.
  - Think about how to make this lesson more manageable by maximizing your time.
  - Break the class into three large groups for activities and reviews. Take one group and have the teaching assistants (TAs) take the other two.
- Prepare for an activity day with a significant amount of card sorting. While card sorting is fun, you will still need to prepare yourself for active participation from you, your TAs, and each student. For example:
- Think about how you and the TAs can most effectively move among the teams.
  - Share the resources for activities via Slack and get verbal or "thumbs up" confirmation that students and groups are good to go. Then send them off to execute the instructions.
  - With TAs, you can float around the classroom (or Zoom rooms) and mix in with students working. Don't wait for students to raise their hands when they are stuck.
- Remind students to bring 3x5 index cards to class (you should also bring extra index cards).
- Run through your demo in advance: Figma/Adobe XD Sitemap Demo (Section 15).
- Prepare to capture pictures of the process during class—take them yourself, as students will be fully engaged.
- Take time to review card sorting. A few resources:
  - [https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html)
  - [https://www.nngroup.com/videos/open-vs-closed-card-sorting/](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/open-vs-closed-card-sorting/)
  - [https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/improving-information-architecture-card-sorting-beginners-guide/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/improving-information-architecture-card-sorting-beginners-guide/)
- Prepare to be engaged with your students' progress by:
  - Working with your TAs to help the teams stay motivated and keep on track.
  - Paying close attention to students’ needs.
  - Encouraging the use of office hours for assistance and feedback.
  - Sharing UI resources and encouraging students to practice often.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Office Hours: Reviews and Practice (45 min before class)

Use time to help students with their weekly challenge, one-on-one check-ins, or supplementary lectures, software tips and tricks. Be proactive with office hour time.

> **Instructor Note:** Encourage your students to make the most out of class, and not to be afraid to ask questions.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Today's Objectives (5 min)

- Open the slides for the lecture: [09-Week/01-slides/09.2 UI Systems and Sitemaps Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VkQegV0RidCIetQqHvlYYAQ_OBXnMwmsK_qzc16pfWs).

  - **TAs:** Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.
- Tell students that UI design will continue to get harder as they layer on more and more skills. You and the TAs are here to help them practice these skills. Their growth will be astounding, but it will take work.

### IA Concepts Review

Remember, the purpose of IA is to help users understand where they are, what they’ve found, what’s around, and what to expect. 

**Put today's lesson into context.**

- Last class, we covered the fundamentals of effective IA, an essential ingredient of successful web design. Today our focus is to apply IA into UI design systems via card sorting activities, sitemapping, and UI navigation.
  - Just as UX is additive in its process, UI design requires making interface solutions from things we've learned, and applying skills in IA to the visualization of UIs.

- Connect today's learning about UI design systems to what students learned in the UX portion of the class. Help them see how everything connects and we're adding dimension to what they've already learned. For example:
  - In UX, we started solutions by identifying our users' needs. Today we'll add more tools for identifying the needs of our users to arrive at more specific UI ideas.
  - UX dives deep into user's needs. Today we will extend solving for our users' needs by designing a usable navigation prototype.
  - UX is a learn-by-doing process and today we will practice designing a usable UI navigation to test our users' experience.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Using broad strokes, share how design systems play into your work.

**Review today's learning objectives.**

- Finally, read through today's learning objectives.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause quickly for any questions before jumping into today's lesson.

## 2. Instructor Do: UI Design Systems and Information Structure (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to define UI design systems and information structure for students and place them within the context of UI design.

In this lecture, you'll give students a high-level overview of the concepts and tools they'll use later in the day—card sorting, sitemapping, and designing a UI navigation.

Remind students that the UI is not the end goal—meeting users' needs is the end goal.

Information architecture (IA) focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way.  The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks.  To do this, you need to understand how the pieces fit together to create the larger picture, how items relate to each other within the system.

Russell Ackoff, a systems theorist and professor of organizational change says the content of the human mind can be classified into 5 categories:
- **Data**: symbols... this represents a fact or statement of events without relation to other things  
- **Information**: data processed to be useful; provides answers to 'who', 'what', 'where', and 'when' questions... embodies the understanding of a relationship of some sort, possibly cause and effect  
- **Knowledge**: application of data and information; answers 'how' questions... refers to a pattern that connects and generally provides a high level of predictability as to what is described or what will happen next  
- **Understanding**: appreciation of 'why'... the process by which we can take knowledge and synthesize nenw knowledge from previously held knowledge    
- **Wisdom**: evaluated understanding... it embodies more of an understanding of fundamental principles embodied within the knowledge that are essentially the basis for the knowledge being what is. Wisdom is essentially systemic.  

## SLIDE 7
The purpose of IA is to help users understand where they are, what they've found, what's around them and what to expect. We use it to inform content strategy including dentifying appropriate verbiage for labels, navigation, microcopy and we use it for informing the decisions we make regarding layout, UI and interaction design.

## SLIDE 8
Review

## SLIDE 9
***Design systems*** are a living, breathing set of design documents and development documentation that outline all the parts of the UI system, business, product, or service. These design elements can change based on user testing, businesses' needs and objectives, and UI direction. Examples include design systems like Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, Microsoft's Metro, and Google's Material Design, but they exist at countless other companies, including Samsung, LG, Ford, and Adobe.

💼 **Employer Competitive Note:** If you are interviewing at a company that has a publicly available design system, you will be expected to speak with some authority on how the UI system is set up. Do your research. You will be required to speak to their system in your job interview and use their documentation as an employee.

Building a design system is an iterative, collaborative process that combines user research, UI design, development, and management. For example:

- No one UX or UI designer creates the whole UI system, but each designer is required to add to that system and iterate the design language over time.

- Larger organizations typically have more established and publicly available design systems.

Today we will be working on creating a UI navigation, which is a foundational piece of any design system. Your users need to navigate your website, and we can create a consistent set of rules that can be applied to all our webpages, apps, or software solutions.

## SLIDE 10
### What Is Information Structure? 

Information structure is the domain of language structure and language study that is concerned with notions such as topic, comment, presupposition, and focus. Put more simply, information structure helps explain why people say things in different ways. 

IA helps build information structure, which constitutes the following values for a design system:

1. Topic: Where they are (navigation and wayfinding).
2. Comment: What they’ve found (labels and tags).
3. Presupposition: What’s around (classification and hierarchy).
4. Focus: What to expect (search and others).

Design systems are collections of reusable components, guided by clearly defined standards used to manage design at scale for an organization or product by reducing redundancy and increaseing consistency.

## SLIDE 11
### Sitemaps

Sitemaps help guide web structure and ultimately lead to navigation UI.

- A sitemap is not a UI.
  - Designing a website or app navigation UI without a sitemap is very difficult because you don’t know what navigation items should or will be.
  - Sitemaps are the seeds, and navigation UI is the plant.

## SLIDE 12
Sitemaps range from simple to detailed and are intended to help communicate structure.

They are generally produced after you have completed your persona and user journey work, and after you have completed your initial discovery period.

Sitemaps show how the information should be structured and identify where content will sit in an organization and what needs to be produced. They help explain the relationship between different pages, which helps when developing a navigation UI. They provide a structure upon which to begin estimates for development. They are the first tangible deliverable showing what you will be creating.

*Card sorting* is an organizational method used to help design or evaluate the IA of a site. A "card" can be as simple as a sticky note or an index card.

When applying card sorting, users group a website's content and develop a hierarchy themselves. Understanding how users group information can provide insights into the users' mental model (i.e., the users' thought process).

## SLIDE 16
**What is card sorting?**

Card sorting is used to help design or evaluate the structure and natural grouping of content particularly helpful with defining the IA of a website, product, or service.

**When do we use card sorting?**

Card sorting is used to help design or evaluate the IA of a site.

- During redesign or usability improvements of a website navigation.
- Conducting user research and attempting to understand how our users think and expect content to be categorized.
- Understanding what a navigation should contain to create labels, categories, and titles.

**Why use card sorting?**

Card sorting is collaborative among designers, users, and clients. In a card sorting session, participants (users and clients) organize information topics into categories that make sense to them. They may also help the UI design team create labels for these groupings. Plus, it builds user data into navigation decisions, because when multiple people place similar items together, that becomes a pattern.

- Content can be hard to organize and combine into usable, useful systems, so card sorting helps add logic and rationale behind decisions.
- It is collaborative among designers, users, and clients. Participants (users and clients) organize topics into categories that make sense to them.
- To communicate how and why a navigation solution is or is not usable.


## SLIDE 17
Card sorting has many benefits and use cases.

Benefits:
- Is simple, cheap, and quick
- Is the established method used by most professionals
- Involves users
- Is flexible
- Provides meaningful results

Use cases:
- Designing a new site
- Designing a new area of a site
- Redesigning a site
- Prototyping in the early stages
- Managing content for a large website

## SLIDE 18
Card sorting sessions can be classified as one of two types—open or closed. Open card sorting is the more flexible option of the two.

Open card sorting:
- In open card sorting, users are free to organize the cards you supply into groups that make sense to them and then come up with their own names for these groups.
- **Best used:** When you want to understand how users would group your content.

Closed card sorting:
- Closed card sorting has fixed categories or labels. 
- **Best used:** When you want to understand how users fit content into an existing structure. It’s also used when new content needs to be added to a website.

Consider an e-commerce website and the top-level categories it might have for its products, such as technology, home and garden, and sports and leisure. Now suppose that the store has started stocking a new range of products that just launched. 

To which top-level category on the website should these products be added? Involving users in a closed card sort could help you arrive at an answer.

## SLIDE 19
Card Sorting allows us to define the data, group it and create structure from it.

#### Preparation for Card Sorting

Like any form of user research, card sorting requires preparation.

- The first task in running an offline session is to prepare your cards. Create a document that lists all of the items you're testing and give each item a number—spreadsheets are ideal for this. These items could be pages in a sitemap, product categories, or labels in a taxonomy. Each item in this list then gets written on a single card, with the corresponding number written on the reverse. This numbering will help if you want to run a more advanced analysis once the sessions are complete.

- For the cards themselves, use actual cards instead of paper, which can get lost, worn out, or torn easily. Also, don’t test too many things at once. Use no more than 30 to 70 items per session. If you’re trying to organize a massive system, break it up into chunks, and then run sessions for each chunk.

## SLIDE 23
- There are three steps that involve **defining, grouping, and organizing** your user information:
  - Step 1: Sort the cards

## SLIDE 24
  - Step 2: Sort into multiple categories

## SLIDE 25
  - Step 3: Structure and label the categories

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Card sorting is a highly relevant skill for creating accurate and effective sitemaps that are driven by users' rationale and data-driven UI solutions. These should be added to your resume skills.

## 4. Student Do: Create Card Sorting Content Cards Activity (10 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity: [09-Week/02-Activities/09.2/09.2-01-Card-Sorting-Card-Creation-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UQujRoJuxp4h34EjoPIqI5Q2zd8V8wl-tf5gIR-SFv4).

Let students know that they will be asked to share their solutions during the activity review. They will have to share their screens, so encourage them to choose one person from their group to present. They should mute notifications and close anything that may contain private information.

- Student teams will collect card sorting information for one of the following websites:
  - [https://www.livenation.com/](https://www.livenation.com/)
  - [https://www.heathceramics.com/](https://www.heathceramics.com/)
  - [https://techcrunch.com/](https://techcrunch.com/)

**Instructor and TAs:** Float around to each group and make sure students are quickly noting all the navigation elements on 3x5 cards. 

Before everyone goes into their breakout rooms, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack are welcome and will be monitored. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through rooms.

While students are writing, take pictures to capture their card sorting process.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** We will be using Miro to execute the card sorting process. Get students who are working on the same government agency into Zoom breakout rooms and have them share one Miro Board. TAs can reference the agency selection template to establish these student groupings. Group size is a minimum of two and a maximum of six. Assign TAs to Zoom breakout rooms to assist students. If students need more activity time, reduce the review time. For each breakout room, assign a student as the leader, and have them share their screen and the Miro Board with the team members.

**Summary**

Students will work in teams and create cards about the navigation of their chosen website (from three options). They’ll use the cards in the next activity.

The goal is to get student groups thinking through the navigation information they capture and start creating information connections.

> **Instructor Note:** We recommend assigning light roles to each card sorting group:
>
>  - Leader: Reads the activity instructions.
>  - Documenter: Captures photos/screenshots of the process.
>  - Time keeper/helper: Keeps time, supports production, etc.

*Tips for students who struggle*: We will start with production, so if teams are struggling with where to start, jump into their group and delegate different website sections. Focus on primary/secondary pages first.

*For students who finish early*: This shouldn't be a problem, but have them make sure that cards are as legible as possible, rewriting some if necessary.

**Instructions**

For this activity, students should gather in groups of five to six people. First, they’ll choose a website to analyze and decide how to divide up their work. Each team member will create his or her cards. The group will then count the cards.

**Deliverable**

At the end of the activity, students will submit a total card count via Slack.

## SLIDES 29-30
## 5. Instructor Do: Create Card Sorting Content Cards Activity Review (5 min)

Call attention back. Make sure everyone has placed their card sorting content into one stack.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** If calling groups back from breakout rooms is too difficult or disruptive, just have student groups report their card count in Slack with a screenshot.

- Quickly review the work of two to three groups.

- Call on each team and ask, "Which webpage? How many 3x5 cards?"

- On the whiteboard, tally the websites and the number of primary and secondary elements.

- Provide students with a few pieces of **actionable feedback** that they can apply directly the next time they do card creation:

  - Don't allow cards items to be repeated. Remove cards that have repeat items within your cards.
  - Legibility is key. Be sure to write a legible as possible (we know it's hard when you are doing it quickly).

> **Instructor Note:** Take any remaining questions about creating cards.

Next, we'll dive deeper into *why* we produced these 3x5 cards and we'll refine the cards and their categories. We'll continue working with the same cards and groups in the next three activities. By the end of class, these cards will be the basis for designing site navigation.

## SLIDES 31-32
## 6. Student Do: Open Card Sorting Activity - Part 1 (10 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity:
[09-Week/02-Activities/09.2/09.2/09.2-02-Open-Card-Sorting-Activity-Google-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1npEg6Zsa9qNheCZPNWEkXEGdJJXJPAyoMU6Id3g1zEU).

> **Instructor Note:** The activity document includes instructions for Part 1 (LP Section 6) and Part 2 (LP Section 8). 
> 
> Use a timer: When half the allotted time for the activity has passed, unmute and let students know. Alternatively, feel free to screen share a countdown timer. One is available on Google by searching timer.

**Instructor and TAs:** For Part 1 of this activity, help students who struggle with transitioning from reviewing to sorting cards. Monitor students and offer help.

Please take photos of the working groups, as they'll be busy, may forget, or not have time.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keep students working together in Miro. With your TAs, pop into each breakout room in Zoom to check on their progress. If students need more time, reduce the review time. Assign a student in each breakout room to be the leader and have them share their Miro board with the other activity members.

**Summary**

This two-part activity will give students practice with card sorting while exploring IA categorization.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Have each student be responsible for a subset of cards and have them focus on a smaller set of 10 cards.

*For students who finish early*: Shouldn't be an issue, but have them help their fellow group members if they complete their sorting early.

**Instructions**

Students will review their cards, add cards for missed items, and divide the cards equally among group members. Next, the group will conduct an open card sorting session.

**Deliverable**

Students will post a photo/screenshot of their card sorting progress in Slack.

## SLIDES 33-34
## 7. Instructor Do: Open Card Sorting Activity - Part 1 Review (5 min)

Call attention back and review a group's first card sorting samples.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Return students to the main room from their breakout rooms. Have students share all their screens.

- Ask the following questions:

  - "Which team wants to share its total number of new categories?"
  - "What were some of the big issues you encountered?"
  - "Do any groups have unknown piles of content?"
- Discuss "too few" versus "too many" navigation items.
- Point out that user testing will improve their ability to catch and strengthen their category titles.
- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they try this skill, for example:
  - Break card groupings of 10 to 20 cards into two or more subcategories.
  - Do card sorting with users. It's enlightening and can help you arrive at user-centered solutions.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about open card sorting. For example:
  - Card sorting is not a final solution but rather a method for adding data to your interface decisions.
  - "Card sorting can only be done for a redesign of a navigation where content exists already." *False.* Card sorting can be used to organize any information but is highly useful for navigation decisions.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a personal story about addressing a navigation structure—what went well or not so well.

Next, students will use the card sorting method to identify and label categories.

## SLIDES 35-36
## 8. Student Do: Open Card Sorting Activity - Part 2 (5 min)

> **Instructor Note:** For Part 2, students will refer to the same activity instructions used for Part 1 (LP Section 6).

**Instructor and TAs:** For Part 2 of this activity, float around with TAs and have students use different color markers or sticky notes.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keep students working together in Zoom breakout rooms and Miro. With your TAs, pop into each breakout room in Zoom to check on their progress. If students need more time, reduce the review time. For each Breakout room, assign a student as the leader, and have them share their Miro board with the other activity members.

**Summary**

Part 2 gives students practice with card sorting collaboratively with their classmates.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Start with one set of grouped cards. Next help the group nominate a single card from that group to be the category title. If no card can be created as the group category, create new card with the chosen title. Work with teams to encourage groups to discuss the category process and labels and come to a consensus.

*For students who finish early*: Have groups recreate the categories as colored sticky notes in all caps (legible writing) and capture photos.

**Instructions**

Tell teams to resume at Part 2 of the activity file.

Students will evaluate their organized cards and add category labels to them.

**Deliverable**

Students will post on Slack a photo of their card sorting progress. 

## SLIDES 37-38
## 9. Instructor Do: Open Card Sorting Activity - Part 2 Review (5 min)

Call attention back and review the work of one or two groups by having students share their screen.

- Ask the following questions:

  - "Which team wants to share its total number of new categories?"
  - "Did your team create a surprising grouping or category? What was it? Why was it surprising?"
  - "Did you disagree where an item should be grouped?"
    - "What was the item?"
    - "How did your team decide on a location?"
  - "Do any groups have unknown piles of content?"
    - User testing will improve students' ability to catch and enhance their category titles.

Before students undertake the final card sorting activity, they'll need to learn about navigation schemes.

## SLIDE 39
Review

## SLIDE 40
***Why are they called "schemes"?*** A scheme is a plan or strategy—something organized to put an idea, or plan, into effect. The term is often applied to marketing, architecture, construction, and, er, organized crime.

As UI designers, we need to consider the navigation scheme of our websites.

### Sitemap Scheme and Structure Lead to a UI

A sitemap is *not* a UI, but it can help inform UI navigation.

## SLIDE 41
**Why use navigation schemes?** 

A navigation scheme is the plan that determines how Web pages will relate to each other. A Web site's structure should support the site's mission. The hierarchical navigation scheme is used by the majority of web sites. The linear navigation scheme is often used with a hierarchical scheme.

**When do we use navigation schemes?**

- When an UX/information architect/UI are working on organizing and establishing layout hierarchy.
- During navigation usability design.
- When a UX/UI designer is organizing content and information.

**Why do we use navigation schemes?**

- Your user is looking for content to be structure and organized in a meaningful matter.
- To make your content more consumable and thus more usable.
- To meet your users’ needs of logical and clear structure.


## SLIDE 42
- **Primary/main navigation:**
  - It is also called main (or global navigation if this is not included) because it is consistent on all pages of a website.

  - The primary/main navigation generally represents the top-level pages of a site’s structure—or the pages just below the home page. The links in the main navigation are expected to lead to pages within the site and behave in a very consistent way. Users don’t expect to land somewhere completely unrelated when using main navigation links. Changes in navigation from page to page are usually small when using the main navigation.

- **Secondary navigation:**
- It is also called sub-nav because it exists inside a primary page. The webpages are the children of the primary navigation.
- Secondary navigation is used to navigate sections or content pages that are associated with its parent navigation item.


- **Tertiary navigation:**
  - It is also called sub-sub-nav because it exists inside a sub-page. This is more complicated and has layers of navigation.


- **Global navigation:**
  - Can be used on more complex websites to maintain a way to navigate a larger organization. This could be to navigate from department to department or from product to product.

- **Utility/optional navigation/supplemental:**
  - Many websites have functional or utility-based features that need to be represented in a navigation like sign-in, account info, profile, search, etc. Accounting for these features can be included in a sitemap as well as linked with global, primary, or secondary UI navigation.

## SLIDE 43
Review

## SLIDE 44
- **Structural navigation:**
  - As its name implies, structural navigation follows the structure of a website. It allows people to move up and down the different points of a site’s hierarchy. Structural navigation can be further subdivided into two types: main navigation and local navigation.

## SLIDE 45
- **Associative navigation:**
  - Associative navigation connects pages with similar topics and content, regardless of their location in the site. Links tend to cross structural boundaries.

## SLIDE 46
- **Utility navigation:**
  - Connects pages and features that help people use the site itself. These may lie outside the main hierarchy of the site, and their only relationship to one another is their function.

- **Local/secondary navigation:**
  - Local navigation is used to access lower levels in a structure, below the main navigation pages. The term “local” implies “within a given category.” On a given page, local navigation generally shows other options at the same level of a hierarchy, as well as the options below the current page.

## 11. Student Do: Card Sorting Reorganization Activity (10 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity: [09-Week/02-Activities/09.2/09.2/09.2-03-Card-Sorting-ReOrg-Activity-Google-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lIo0gAscadYbMC4ZGe9qgGH6r3uzge_2TdnnhtaxyLM). 

**Instructor and TAs:** Ask TAs to monitor Slack for questions. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students return to their Zoom breakout rooms to keep working in Miro. With your TAs, pop into each breakout room to check on their progress. If students need more time, you can reduce the review time. For each breakout room, assign a student as the leader, and have them share their Miro board with the other activity members.

Ask the groups, "What is your group's organizing principle?"

*Tips for students who struggle*: Work with teams and remind them of LATCH from the prior class Lesson 9.1. Help groups start with A - alphanumeric before choosing a different principle.

*For students who finish early*: Have groups take a photograph and challenge them to organize in a second version. There are many ways to organize your card sorting categories. Don't just choose one and stick with it.

**Summary**

Students will reorganize their site's navigation.

**Instructions**

In this activity, students will work in groups of five to six. In Part 1, they'll determine what organizing principle to use for their primary categories, then sort the cards according to that principle. In Part 2, they'll take the same approach to organizing the secondary categories.

**Deliverable**

For both parts of this activity, students will share a photo documenting their categorization work. 

## SLIDES 50-51
## 12. Instructor Do: Card Sorting Reorganization Activity Review (10 min)

🌐**Online class:** Call attention back to the front of the class by using the gallery view in Zoom. Aim to review the work of two to three groups.

- Ask questions:
  - "Which team wants to share its new structure?"
  - "What was your organizing principle?"
  - "Do you think it is better?"

- Discuss completing this activity with future clients.

  - Card sorting is not exclusively an IA job. Getting input from the real user or your client is valuable.

  - User testing will improve your ability to catch and improve your category titles.

  - Working remotely with clients and getting data feedback from users on information design is key to justifying structural changes and modifying navigation.
  - **TAs:** share the following link in Slack:
      - [Optimizly](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort)
      - [Miro.com](https://miro.com/app/)
      - [Mural.co](https://mural.co/)

## SLIDE 52
- UX/UI cares about:
  - **01—Organization schemes and structures:**
    - How users categorize information, assisted by card sorting

  - **02—Labeling systems:**
    - How users represent information
    - How we give card sorted categories labels

  - **03—Navigation systems:**
    - How users browse through the information
    - How we structure information through a sitemap

  - **04—Search systems:**
    - How users look for and find information
    - How we create UI navigation from our sitemaps

  - Take care with creating an organization system for your cards that is clear and logical.
  - Your team might love a structure and organization, but you must always validate it with your users.
  - Capture your organization process. Photograph your process, too. These are highly useful in your portfolio case studies.

**What's a sitemap?**

A sitemap is a diagram of the structure of a website or app. Sitemaps are based on card sorting. Liken sitemapping to creating a seating chart for a huge event; there must be a seat for each person, the people must be organized by relationship or another criterion, and also grouped into tables.

Sitemapping seems easy but is detailed and requires lots of attention.

- Sitemaps help visualize knowledge about the structure of our webpage systems.

  - Card sorting has produced some knowledge about user navigation.


The sitemap you ultimately create needs to have a few key attributes:

- A homepage/home screen item at the top
- A reference number for each item in the sitemap (this helps when creating wireframes or functional specifications)
- A label for each item in the sitemap


## SLIDE 56
**When use a sitemap?**

- Redesigning or improving the usability of website navigation.
- Conducting user research and attempting to understand how our users think and expect content to be organized.
- Understanding what a navigation should contain to create labels, categories, and titles.

**Why use a sitemap?**

- Websites can be hard to organize and combine into usable, useful systems, so sitemaps help add logic and rationale behind decisions.
- It is collaborative among users, designers, developers, and stakeholders. Participants (users and stakeholders) organize topics into categories that make sense.
- To communicate how and why a website structure exists as well as tool for scoping the size of a web design project.

A sitemap is generally a reasonably basic diagram. If your website has an unusually large amount of content, you may wish to split your sitemap into several pages. Showing one category per page with a top-level overview at the beginning is preferable.

## SLIDE 62

### How to Make a Sitemap

The homepage should start with reference number 1.0, and categories beneath it should increase numerically (i.e., the first category would be 2.0, the second 3.0, and so on). Content should follow this same pattern, with content beneath category 2.0 going in the format 2.1, 2.2, and so on.

Sitemaps have their heuristics and best practices:

- Findable
- Accessible
- Clear
- Communicative
- Usable

- Controllable
- Valuable
- Learnable

## 15. Instructor Do: Demo - Figma/Adobe XD Sitemap (10 min)

🌐**Online class:** Using Zoom, share your screen by clicking on the green Share Screen button in your lower Control Panel. Ensure all notifications have been muted, any personal information has been cleared from your screen, and that the lesson plan is not visible.

As you will also be displaying other applications on your computer throughout the class, it may be best to share an entire desktop at once and launch any class-related applications only on this desktop.

The goal of your demo is to teach students how to use Adobe XD components/Figma components to build a sitemap. They will do this themselves in the activity that follows. Specifically, you'll show them how to manipulate primary and secondary page components.

1. Download and open [IA-Sitemap-Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rAuxVcupCLllJesL0SaxdxvIp-9pVSlc). 
2. Review the sitemap structure.
   ![XD-sitemap-sample.png](Images/XD-sitemap-sample.png)
3. Call out the distinction between primary and secondary pages.
4. Go into the component section.
    - Make the primary page color blue.
5. Create the utilities/features card as a new Figma/Adobe XD component from scratch.
   - Add a rectangle, the type, and an information label.
   - Group the elements.
   - Create a component (Command-K), and then label the component.
   - Copy the component a few times.
   - Manipulate the root component.

- Good job—now it is the students' turn to try.

In the following two-part activity, students will create sitemaps based on the navigation they came up with during their card sorting activity.

## SLIDES 66-67
## 16. Student Do: Figma/Adobe XD Sitemap Activity v. 1 (10 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following links:

- [09.2-04-IA-Sitemap-Figma-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/WMJr9KalfdZtMTjLrlA3Zv/09.2-04-IA-Sitemap-Template)

> **Instructor Note:** The document contains instructions for Part 1 (LP Section 16) and Part 2 (LP Section 18).

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor students and offer support as they use Adobe XD components/Figma Components and create their sitemaps.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. If students need more time, you can shorten the review.

**Summary**

This two-part activity gives students a chance to dive deeper into the content hierarchy as well as get hands-on practice using Figma/Adobe XD to build sitemaps.

Students will practice using Figma/Adobe XD to build a sitemap from their team's card sorting activity, and share their results when the activity is over. 

*Tips for students who struggle*: Have students start top-down from their card sorting organization. Make sure each student has placed a screenshot of their card sorting into the side canvas space of Figma/Adobe XD to decrease context shifting.

*For students who finish early*: Have them capture their execution and put in Slack. TAs can give quick feedback

**Instructions**

Working independently in Figma/Adobe XD, students will create a sitemap that contains primary and secondary pages. The sitemap should contain the components outlined in the activity instructions and a defined sitemap logic.

**Deliverable**

Students will upload and share in Slack the sitemap they created in Figma/Adobe XD.

## SLIDES 68-69
## 17. Instructor Do: Figma/Adobe XD Sitemap Activity v. 1 Review (5 min)

It's time to review how the sitemapping went for students and reinforce their learning.

- Aim to review the work of two to four students.
- Switch to the gallery view and ask the following questions:
  - "What did you learn about your hierarchy? Your sitemap?"
  - "Why did you organize your sitemap this way?"
  - "If you had to show this to your grandmother, would she be able to follow it?"
- Now, provide students with a couple pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they try this skill, for example:
  - Double-check that the pages numbered and show clear primary, secondary, tertiary relationships.
  - Sitemaps should be as big as they are clear. Don't allow the artboard size to cramp the sitemap visualization.

- Briefly discuss gathering samples and using those samples, which is a big part of their challenge and UI practice.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share (or ask a TA to share) how you have collected samples and inspiration for your own work on UI navigation.

It's time to dive deeper into sitemapping. Iteration is key to any design solution and students should be encouraged to improve their work continually. We produce a lot of work quickly in class, but students should refine their work by iterating on it because this work will go into their portfolios.

Next, students will create an iteration of their sitemap.

## SLIDES 70-71
## 18. Student Do: Figma/Adobe XD Sitemap Activity v. 2 (10 min)

> **Instructor Note:** Students should work from the same document for Part 1 (LP Section 16).

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor students and offer support as they use Figma/Adobe XD and create their sitemaps.

Students who are struggling should ask teammates to review their solutions, as they're working on the same card sorting activity.

**Summary**

Please encourage students to make an iteration of their sitemap. They should follow the activity instructions for adding communication improvements, color, and typography to their sitemaps.

**Instructions**

Students should continue working independently in Figma/Adobe XD for Part 2 and work from a copy of their v. 1 artboard. To this, they'll add color, page connections, and typography.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. If students need more time, shorten the review.

**Deliverable**

Students will upload and share in Slack the sitemap they created in Figma/Adobe XD.

## SLIDES 72-73
## 19. Instructor Do: Figma/Adobe XD Sitemap Activity v. 2 Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention and lead a review of their sitemapping iteration.

- Aim to review the work of two to four students.
- Discuss the most prominent strategies.
- Discuss a few ways to help improve IA sitemap logic, using the following questions as inspiration:

  - "Why have you designed your sitemap this way?"
  - "What is your navigation scheme?"
  - "If you had to show this to your grandmother, would she be able to follow it?"

- Now, provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they try this skill, for example:
  - Make sure your colors reinforce the structure and organization—but don't make them obnoxious.
  - Be as clear and precise with your connecting lines.
  - Date and version your sitemaps so teams know what they are looking at when it is eventually shared.

- Next, discuss common mistakes made on sitemaps:
1. Page titles are too small.
2. Sitemap is missing an organizing principle (LATCH).
3. Color is overused or underused.
4. Sitemap is missing a key.
5. Pages are missing a numbering convention.

You've now wrapped up Part 2 of this lesson on sitemapping. Students have achieved the third learning objective: creating a sitemap that defines primary, secondary, and tertiary page distinctions.

Next, you're moving on to the third and final part of the lesson: UI navigation. This next section builds on what students have just learned and prepares them to design a UI navigation for their site in Figma/Adobe XD.

- The content structure has an impact on how a UI will get designed.
  - A sitemap is *not* a UI.
    - A site map is just a visual representation of the structure of webpage in a website.
  - A sitemap *informs* a UI.
    - It informs navigation by aligning UI teams to page and title names, amount of primary, secondary, and tertiary relationships, as well as potential content types that each webpage will represent.

- When to use it?
  - Use it after the sitemap has been completed and the information categories for a website or app are defined.
    - For example: Say that your client's site needs to improve its usability, and so you revamp the navigation organization and navigation scheme through a new sitemap and homepage redesign.
- Why use it?
  - A navigation UI is how your users interact with the website defined in a sitemap. A sitemap informs navigation.
    - For example: Say a client wants to add another tab to your primary navigation. You don't just bloat the navigation solution—you can use user-centered data to determine the best UI solution for all items, not just the client's new ask.

## SLIDE 77
### Navigation UI Is Defined Through a Scheme

- A desktop navigation scheme is different from a mobile application navigation scheme because the way users interact with different screen sizes.

  - UI navigation considers global, local, supplemental, and contextual navigation.

  - Point to the typical locations where each navigation might be found in a UI.

  - Primary navigation: The pages and content that the users are the most interested in should be included in the highest profile primary navigation. The menu is generally placed in the most visible location—usually horizontally across the top of the site, but just below the header and logo.

  - Secondary navigation (sub-nav): Pages that are important but less visited often are included as children of primary pages. These are generally  included inside primary navigation dropdowns and their color, size, and font decrease their visibility somewhat.

    - For usability, do try to limit the number of secondary pages in a navigation and sitemap structure.

## 21. Student Do: Sketch a Desktop Figma/Adobe XD Navigation Activity (15 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity: [09-Week/02-Activities/09.2/09.2/09.2-05-XD-UI-Navigation-Deskop-Activity](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UALLWgLFJ1owI7BFsA6EiiFP5CoEryQq-hyyBVYmtxM).

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor students and offer to help those with questions or who are struggling.

Students will use Figma/Adobe XD to execute a UI, so make sure they're using UI grids and designing for desktop navigation first.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. If students need more time, you can shorten the review.

**Summary**

This activity gives students practice implementing their sitemap from the previous activity and using it as the basis for designing navigation for their government site using Figma/Adobe XD. 

*Tips for students who struggle*: Have students start by prototyping only the primary pages first before moving onto the secondary and tertiary UI solutions.

*For students who finish early*: Shouldn't be an issue as this is part of their challenge; the more progress they make in class, the less work they have at home. 

**Instructions**

Students will work on their own for this three-part activity.

First, students will set up their artboard in Figma/Adobe XD. Next, they'll design their navigation, including primary and secondary site pages and navigation states (i.e., pages not visited, active, visited). Finally, they'll export their artboard and share it with the class in Slack.

**Deliverable**

Students will design a navigation for their government site on an artboard in Figma/Adobe XD, which they'll export and share via Slack.

**Bonus:** Design a footer to match your navigation design.

## SLIDE 87
## 22. Instructor Do: Sketch a Desktop Figma/Adobe XD Navigation Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

- Lead the class in a review of their Figma/Adobe XD UI navigation solutions. Use the following to jumpstart your discussion:

  - "What navigation scheme did you come up with?"
  - "Why did you choose to place your navigation where you did (top, bottom, sides, etc.)?"
  - "Share how your card sorting informed your UI."
  - "What problems came up?"

- Discuss a few solutions to problems that came up with the class.
- Now, provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they try this skill. For example:

  - Try starting with a wireframe; don't get into too many color or typography decisions at first, just focus on the Navigation structure and interaction.

  - Use a UI grid as discussed in Unit 8 to create evenly-spaced UI Navigation elements and improve your usability.

  - Your best bet is starting with established UI patterns first—i.e., Nav at the top as tabs—before experimenting with alternative UI solutions.

- Next, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about UI navigation. For example:

  - "Navigation has only one optimal solution." *False.* There are thousands of ways to execute a navigation. All need to be validated with our users for the best usability.

  - "Navigation is a hill worth dying on." *False.* Advocate the best you can for your users and create usable and useful navigation systems. Still, the reality is that a team builds a navigation and clients sometimes get what they want even if it's not in the users' best interest.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions. This is a good opportunity for students to clarify navigation concepts that remain unclear to them.

The only thing left for your class to do is review the concepts. Reinforce students' learning by asking them to recall ideas from today's lesson.

## 23. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)

In the remaining time, lead the class in an active recall exercise of key concepts. This will help students retain what they've learned.

Have students get into groups of four and spend three minutes discussing their answers to the following questions:

- What is card sorting and what is its role in UI design?

- How do open and closed card sorting differ?

- What are examples of navigation schemes?
  - Ask students to describe the navigation scheme example and why it might be used.

- When and why do designers create sitemaps?

- When and why do designers create UI navigation?

Ask one student from each group to share their group's answers. Listen for clues that reveal only partial understanding of concepts. **If time allows, clarify weak concepts on the spot, or invite students to stay for office hours.**

Encourage students to use today's lesson and activities to inspire continued learning. To become successful designers, they must practice these skills. For example, students should iterate the navigation they designed in the final activity, create additional sitemaps, and practice card sorting on their own.

> **Instructor Note:** See if there are any questions. Remind students to take advantage of office hours, as you'll be able to address lengthy questions and/or demonstrate concepts.

Thank the students for their participation and wish everyone a good night.
