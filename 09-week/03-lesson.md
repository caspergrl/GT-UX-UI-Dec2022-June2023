# 9.3 Lesson Plan: UI Brand Fundamentals

---

## Overview

Today's class will introduce students to the fundamentals of UI design branding. Students will learn about UI style guides, brand positioning statements, brand voice, and iconography.

Lesson 9.1 introduced the fundamentals of effective information architecture (IA), which is essential to successful web design and organizing information in a clear, logical way so that users can process it easily. Lesson 9.2 covered UI design systems, sitemaps, navigation, information structures, and card sorting as well as its application for IA and navigation schemes. As a whole, Unit 9 enables students to evaluate logical information categories, create usable UI navigation systems, and practice applying information design strategies to a webpage prototype.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Analyze a UI style guide.
2. Articulate a clear and precise brand positioning statement.
3. Determine the dos and don'ts for the voice and tone of a brand using a brand matrix.
4. Create a UI style tile for an online brand.

## Class at a Glance

Welcome to Lesson 9.3 on UI brand fundamentals. Today's class is divided into four parts:

- Part 1 will introduce UI style guides.
- Part 2 will cover brand positioning statements.
- Part 3 will teach brand voice and tone.
- Part 4 will explain iconography and UI style tiles.

By the end of the lesson, students will understand how branding influences UI design and guides decision-making for design teams.

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: 🌐) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activities and activity reviews by doing an activity as a class instead of creating breakout groups. 

>  **Instructor Note:** If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Preparing for Class

- The knowledge and skills taught today are a foundation for UI and front-end development projects.

- Read through the Lesson 9.3 lecture *and* review the slides: [09-Week/01-slides/09.3 UI Brand Voice and Tone Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K6NE05FZXQOaZm41vOC-_lTNljWBAp7zK4O6ao-I1I0).

- Keep in mind that Unit 9 is a very demanding week covering a large volume of content.
  - Make this lesson more manageable by maximizing your time:
    - Break the class into three large Zoom breakout groups for activities and reviews. Take one group and have the teaching assistants (TAs) take the other two. ***Each group can work through the activities, then move right into the reviews together.***

- Prepare to be engaged with your students’ progress by:
  - Working with your TAs to help students.
  - Paying close attention to students’ individual needs.
  - Encouraging the use of office hours for challenge assistance and feedback.
  - Sharing UI resources and encouraging students to practice often.

## Office Hours: Reviews and Practice  (45 min before class)

Some of your students might be new to UI and visual design. Use Slack polls or surveys to identify topics that could be reviewed during office hours.

> **Instructor Note:** Encourage your students to make the most out of class and not to be afraid to ask questions.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Introduce UI Design 2.0 and Share Today's Objectives (5 min)

- Open the slides for the lecture: [09-Week/01-slides/09.3 UI Brand Fundamentals](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K6NE05FZXQOaZm41vOC-_lTNljWBAp7zK4O6ao-I1I0).

  - Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for the class. Share slides in Slack.

  - UI design will continue to get harder, but we're here to help you gain these skills. Although it will take work, your growth will be astounding.
- Share today's objectives with the class.
- Connect today's lesson to what students learned in the UI portion of the boot camp. How does what they already know about UX help them today? How are we adding dimension to their foundation in UX? For example:

  - UX is helpful in framing the right problem to solve for our users. Today we will focus on how to make that solution look and feel like your brands.

  - A big piece of understanding UX/UI is the overlap of needs from your user and your business. We will practice business thinking by defining a brand position statement.

  - UI development starts by extending human-centered values into the visuals and extending empathy skills into a UI style guide.

## UI Design Process

- Review the design > develop > test cycle of iterative design.
- Ask students why the design > develop > test cycle exists.
  - Ask, *"Why is the UI design process iterative?"*

    - *Iteration* is a feedback cycle for making design better and motivating software teams to work together.

> **Instructor Note:** Share a personal story of iterating your own work.

- Below are questions to ask during an interview about a team's iterative process:

  - What does iteration look like on your team?
  - What is your typical design sprint?
  - Who is responsible for testing?
  - Do you use an agile methodology for software development?
  - How does your team plan for new features?

**Set the stage for today's lesson.**

Last class, students created sitemaps. In the class before that, they studied IA. Now that they have their structural and navigational pieces in place, it's time to add the branding layer. Branding involves layout decisions, icons, fonts, brand voice, and color—all of which bring the UI design process full circle.

We'll start with style guides.

## 2. Instructor Do: UI Style Guides (15 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to introduce style guides and explain their value to designers. This ties into the first of today's learning objectives, the ability to analyze a style guide.

> **Instructor Note:** UI style guide concepts are hard, and students will not have mastered their website solutions yet. If students are brand new to some of these concepts, they'll need to double down at home and practice iteration.

You'll start the branding lesson by teaching style guides. UI style guides are the "maps" that dictate the dos and don'ts for designers and how design teams manage a brand across an organization.

### Introduce UI Style Guides

Design style guides are a building block for a brand. Simply put, a style guide is a set of rules for how a brand, product, or service lives in the world.

Branding is a broad topic that involves marketing, business, and products/services.

- We'll cover branding topics quickly, so prepare your students for an accelerated pace. Remind them that UI is a relatively new profession compared to being a doctor or an architect, and it requires rapid learning to keep pace with changes.

- All good brands have a great style guide. Creating a simple booklet that catalogs the specific colors, type, logos, imagery, patterns, and taglines of a brand ensures consistency. To prove why style guides matter, we’re going to look at 50 stunning and detailed examples of style guides.

### Review the UI Style Guide Tool Snapshot

**What is a UI Style Guide?**

- During redesign, or usability improvements of a website navigation
- Doing user research and attempting to understand how our users think and expect content to be organized .
- Understand what a navigation should contain to create labels categories, and titles.

**When do designers use a UI Style Guide?**

- Throughout the design process particularly before developing any high-fidelity prototypes or mock-up screen executions.
- Develop and produce with the help of visual designers to establish rules and consistency with a brand.

**Why do we use a UI Style Guide?**

- A UI style guide brings cohesion and consistency to a digital product’s UI and experience.

### Types of Style Guides

There are two types of style guides: brand and UI.

- Review the goals of the UI style guide.

- Review the style guide development process.

  - Let's start building our style guides.

**What happens if you don't have a style guide?**

Too few businesses take the time to create a company brand style guide. In the absence of a unifying style guide, team members might apply incorrect or inconsistent content and branding. Over time, such mixed marketing messages confuse your followers. Also, incompatible messaging can undermine a company's integrity and leave a lasting negative impression, especially if the message is hard to retract once posted online. In the end, the brand you've worked so hard to create is diluted and diminished in the eyes of your target audience.

**Why do designers create style guides?**

It is important for designers to create and maintain a brand style guide. If your company is like most, your brand (including logo, tagline, graphics, and text elements) is handled by many before it is released to the public.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, you will be expected to build professional solutions that stand up to competition in the market. Analyzing other companies' style guides will make you more competitive, and competitive analysis should be a skill added to your resume and LinkedIn profiles.

### What Goes Into a UI Style Guide?

- **Logo:** Define and give examples of your logo. Show how your logo should be used in various formats, including full color, black and white, transparent, or on different backgrounds.

- **Color palette:** Provide hex and RGB color values for each palette color. Include recommended color combinations.

- **Typography:** Define the font families; point sizes; kerning, leading, and tracking; and colors for various content types: headers, subheads, paragraphs, citations, block quotes, labels, form headers, or any other formatted text used.

- **Layout:** Define where and how HTML and other elements are positioned on the page and how they relate to each other. Define margins, padding, gutters, or grid patterns of the overall layout as well as any specific elements if different.

- **Links and buttons:** Define the colors and styles for all links (content, sidebar, etc.) and buttons (submit, form, info, etc.). Show examples and hex values for links and buttons.

- **Graphics and iconography:** Define what type, sizes, file sizes, dimensions, and styles should be used for graphics and icons on your site. Do you have specific icon sets that need to be used?

- **Navigation:** Define the main and sub-navigation styles as well as the interactivity among them. Define what happens when nesting or parent/child navigation is used, and show examples of how the navigation should be used or created.

- **Imagery and photography:** Define the style for the use of imagery. Do you want images in soft focus? Is it OK to show people’s faces? Real people or stock images? In black and white or in color?

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** If you've developed a style guide, quickly share it with the students. Alternatively, relate a struggle you experienced professionally due to the lack of a style guide.

Now that students understand the importance of style guides for guiding UI design decisions, it's time for them to study a style guide. They'll analyze the components of a style guide in the following small group activity.

## 3. Student Do: UI Style Guide Analysis Activity (10 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity: [09-Week/02-Activities/09.3/09.3-01-Analyze-UI-Style-Guide-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vURMktNh9NbYXppUmnLN6tC-AkRMFesBxv8Yx1aHsFM).

**Instructor and TAs:** Float among student groups offering help. Please encourage them to consider that a style guide is not only for the designer but also for the content, branding, and development teams as well.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Group students into Zoom breakout rooms in groups of two to three. Assigns TAs to the groups. (Tip: TAs can reference the agency selection template in order to establish these student groupings.) If students need more time, you can reduce the review time.

**Summary**

In this activity, students will get into groups of two to three to review, divide, and answer some questions about the use of style guides.

*Tips for students who struggle*: There are a lot of style guides to choose from. If a student struggles, choose a brand for them.

*For students who finish early*: This should not be a problem but have students continue to research about designing and maintaining a UI style guide.

**Instructions**

Students will work in groups of two to three for this three-part activity.

In Part 1, groups will choose a style guide and decide how to divide it up for analysis.

In Part 2, groups will take screenshots of the style guide components and answer the questions in the activity document.

In Part 3, groups will export their analysis in a Google Doc to share via Slack.

**Deliverable**

Students will perform and document a group analysis of a style guide and share their results in the form of a Google Doc.

## 4. Instructor Do: UI Style Guide Analysis Activity Review (10 min)

Call attention back to the front of the class and lead a review of the groups' style guide analyses.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Aim to review the work of one to two teams with the class.
- Use these questions as possible discussion prompts:
  - *Why did you choose this style guide?*
  - *What did you find useful?*
  - *Did every member of your team find it equally useful?*
  - *Did the style guide help or hurt your opinion of the brand? Why?*

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about style guide analysis. For example:

  - "Style guides are only for big companies with lots of money." *False.* Any business that represents itself in the world can benefit from keeping its brand consistent.

  - "Style guides are only helpful for designers." *False.* We collaborate now more than ever. A style guide can help everyone at a company do their job better. From press releases to social media, they all represent the brand.

This wraps up the style guide part of today's lesson. This means that students have fulfilled the learning objective about analyzing a style guide. Congratulate them.

The next part of your lesson deals with brand positioning. The following lecture will prepare students to write their own brand positioning statements, which is their second learning objective. Think of a brand positioning statement as a written form of a style guide, or an extension of a style guide. Let's dive in.

## 5. Instructor Do: Brand Positioning Statements (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this lecture is to introduce brand thinking and articulation, which supports today's second learning objective, articulate a clear and precise brand positioning statement.

Here you will detail what makes a well-defined brand positioning statement in order to prepare students to write their own in the activity that follows.

A brand positioning statement achieves three things: it explains what your brand does, its benefits, and who it targets.

> **Say:** People don’t tend to drive somewhere they’ve never been before without first consulting a map. Companies often continue down the road they are on without stopping to think where they want to go. Writing a brand positioning statement will help define the sort of company you aspire to be and give marketing a consistent voice.

### Review the Brand Positioning Tool Snapshot

**What is a brand positioning statement?**

They explain what your brand does, who you target, and the benefits of your brand in a short, concise statement.

The positioning statement is probably the most critical sentence in a marketing plan. It brings focus to the development of a marketing strategy and the tactics supporting that strategy.

- The statement will generally be an internal document, although it should be used as a guide to ensure all content is consistent.
- A brand positioning statement lets you create a tagline or slogan.

**When do designers utilize brand positioning?**  

- During the definition of your users and your business as it is very hard to identify what a UI brand can be without a starting place from your business.
- Understand how a user experiences a brand.

**Why do we use brand positioning?**

- During the definition of your users and your business as it is very hard to identify what a UI brand can be without a starting place from your business.
- Understand how a user experiences a brand.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As UX/UI designers, you will be working with the brands of your companies when you get a job. Being able to demonstrate the understanding, thinking, and hard work that goes into a UI brand will allow you to be trusted to execute that brand yourself when you get the UX/UI job.

### Elements of Brand Positioning Statements

Review the four elements of brand positioning statements:

1. **The category in which the brand operates:** The category/industry/vertical your brand operates in will often be self-explanatory, but it can be beneficial to think about this. Your product might overlap into multiple categories. Defining the exact space in which you operate helps focus your direction.

2. **The target audience:** You might have more than one, but focusing on your primary target group gives a more explicit message. It can be a good idea to work out who your most valuable customers are before deciding on this.

3. **The benefit to the customer:** Not the shiny new feature that you are delighted with, but the actual benefit the customer will derive from being a customer of your brand.

4. **The reason why the brand will deliver on this promise:** A brand might be the most cost-effective option available by not having brick-and-mortar stores. Whatever the reason, there has to be something backing up your claim.

>:gem: **Designer Insight:** Invite a TA to relate his or her own anecdote or share one of your own about the amount of practice it takes to get really good at writing brand positioning statements.

### Examples of Brand Positioning Statements

Amazon.com used the following positioning statement in 2001, when it almost exclusively sold books:

"For World Wide Web users who enjoy books, Amazon.com is a retail bookseller that provides instant access to over 1.1 million books. Unlike traditional book retailers, Amazon.com delivers a combination of extraordinary convenience, low prices, and comprehensive selection."

Review the brand positioning statement template as well as the boot camp and Listerine examples. 

Students now have an understanding of the four key ingredients of a brand positioning statement, so there is no better time to practice writing one of their own. Next up, students will write the brand positioning statement for their government agency.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for any questions.

## 6. Student Do: Brand Positioning Statement Activity (25 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity and read the instructions:
[09-Week/02-Activities/09.3/09.3-02-Brand-Positioning-Statement-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p2ZKnnHXEq5Aih7iLpVeSHKPlOvtcIOghKmQi5b8NhI).

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor the students and offer to help those who are struggling with filling out the template or have questions.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Group students who are working on the same government agency into Zoom breakout rooms in groups of two to four people. Assign TAs to the groups. (Tip: TAs can reference the agency selection template in order to establish these student groupings.) If students need more activity time, you can reduce the review time.

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is for students to write a brand positioning statement for the government agency website they chose from the previous week’s activity.

*Tips for students who struggle*: With TAs, mix in with teams and help any struggling students. Have them start with a few brand goals.

*For students who finish early*: Teams can always iterate their statements or write more and vote as a team. Encourage iteration rather than stopping once they finish.

**Instructions**

Students will work individually and in groups for this three-part activity:

- In Part 1, students will fill out their template for brand positioning individually.
- In Part 2, the groups give feedback.
- In Part 3, students will iterate their brand positioning statements.

**Deliverable**

Students’ brand positioning statements should contain the four elements: the category for the brand, target audience, customer benefit, and why the brand can deliver on its promise. Students will submit their statements in a Google Doc via Slack.

## 7. Instructor Do: Brand Positioning Statement Activity Review (10 min)

Call attention back to the front of the class and lead a review of students' brand positioning statements.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Aim to review the statements of three to four students.
- Start by asking the student presenting their work to talk through their process and what they hoped to express with their brand positioning statement.
- Follow that by asking questions to stimulate a class discussion:
  - *Is there a brand positioning statement that stands out? Why?*
  - *Are there any similarities? Are they too similar?*
  - *Is the statement aspirational—reflecting what the agency hopes to become?*
  - *Are there any differences? Are they too different?*

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about brand positioning statements. For example:

  - "Only brand consultants get to work on these." *False.* Any business can benefit from applying a specific, clear, and sharable brand statement.

  - "A brand positioning statement is not relevant in our fast-paced world." *False.* The ability to communicate effectively in a world with thousands of apps all screaming at us for attention is hard. Helping your businesses create a signal through the noise is essential to making great user experiences.

Before moving on, ask students to practice active recall by naming the key ingredients of a brand positioning statement:

1. What the brand does/category
2. Who it's for/customer
3. The benefit(s) to the customer
4. The reason why it will succeed/uniqueness

This wraps up Part 2 of today's lesson, which was to introduce students to brand positioning. They have achieved another learning objective, how to create brand positioning statements—congratulate them. Next, you'll be talking about how a brand is expressed in a more nuanced way, through voice and tone.

## 8. Break (15 min)

Invite everyone to take a break.

Let students know that when they come back from break, they'll learn about voice and tone—also known as the *personality* of a brand.

> **Instructor Note:** If the day is already running long, feel free to shorten the break.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Don't stop sharing your screen. Instead, put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual time will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

## 9. Instructor Do: UI Brand, Voice, and Tone (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to help students understand the value of language, voice, and tone as part of their UI design work. This lecture supports today's third learning objective, identifying brand dos and don'ts using a brand matrix.

> **Instructor Note:** Communication is subtle, and getting students to think deeply about their communication decisions requires some consideration. Students must practice observation to develop the skill. As UI designers, they'll be expected to participate in brand voice decisions and be able to stand by their use of language, both visual and written. Encourage students to start being mindful of how others are communicating with them.

You've been building up to this: First, there was the style guide and then the brand positioning statement. With voice and tone, you're talking about how those pieces of the brand puzzle are expressed. A brand's voice and tone are the expression of the style guide and brand positioning statement.

If the style guide is the script, voice and tone are what tell the actor to use a joyful or somber quality when they read their lines. It's the *expression* of the character or brand.

### Seth Godin Quote

Share the following quote from author and business executive Seth Godin: 
- "A brand is a set of expectations, memories, stories, and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another. If the consumer (whether it’s a business, a buyer, a voter, or a donor) doesn’t pay a premium, make a selection, or spread the word, then no brand value exists for that consumer."

  - **TAs,** slack out [https://seths.blog/2009/12/define-brand/](https://seths.blog/2009/12/define-brand/), which is a longer definition of brands that students should read at home.

  - Recommend following Seth Godin's blog and listening to his podcast, which usually focuses on marketing.

- Brands are complicated. A UI is just one aspect of a brand, but it can be a crucial aspect.

  - For example, imagine if you want to buy a pair of shoes. You find the pair you want, but when you go to purchase the shoes, they are out of stock. Frustrating, right? This experience has just damaged the brand. It was a failure in the UI to inform the user of availability.

  - **Ask,** "*How likely are you to buy that pair of shoes?*"

  - One bad experience will not drive users away from your brand, hopefully. UI designers must "**sweat the details**" so that users have as few bad experiences on a website as possible.

  - When we get the functional/emotional considerations tuned to our user, it creates lasting value for our UI and our brands.

### Brand Personality

Something essential to consider when thinking about a brand and UI is its voice and personality. By intimately understanding your customer, you’re able to shape your brand personality in a way that evokes the “like, know, and trust” factor.

- **TAs,** slack out the following for students to read at home:
  - [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-retail-study-shows-marketers-under-leverage-emotional-connection-300720049.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-retail-study-shows-marketers-under-leverage-emotional-connection-300720049.html)
  - [https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jennifer-lynn-aaker](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jennifer-lynn-aaker)

### Voice and Tone 

The personality of your brand is determined, in large measure, by the words you use and the sentences you write. UI is an extension of the "brand voice." UI should work with content strategy to craft the language and personality.

### Review the brand voice and tone tool snapshot

**What is brand voice and tone?**

- The tone and voice drive how you communicate in all your brand’s actions and interactions. Your voice, tone, and temperament should be wholly distinctive and consistent in all aspects of your brand.

**When do we use brand voice and tone?** 

- During the definition of your users and your business as how you speak to your audience matters to your UI and brand.
- Understand how a user experience a brand.

**Why do we use brand voice and tone?**

- Brand voice and tone can help stakeholders + designers + developers all be consistent with how they use language and align for who they are communicating to.

### **Voice for a brand is important, and varied:**

Consider the voice and personality along a spectrum between two ideas, for example:

- Formal to informal or professional to relaxed, etc.
- Coca-Cola is "happy," Disney is "magic," Southwest is "friendly," and FedEx is "efficient."

### Tone

If your voice is funny/humorous, is your tone:

- Funny "ha-ha"?
- Sarcastic?
- Mean funny?
- Dark humor?

### MailChimp Voice and Tone Style Guide

Point out to students that MailChimp has created a fantastic case study of what a voice and tone style guide should be. Tell students that in a world where voice interface technology—Amazon's Alexa, Google Home, and Apple's Siri—continues to evolve, voice and tone will only become more important.

- **TAs,** slack out a link to the [Mailchimp style guide voice and tone](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/) for students to read at home. This guide can help when they create their own voice and tone for the government brands in their weekly challenge assignment.

Brands are not people, but they are made up of people. People use brands. UX and UI care about people. If we can figure out what matters to users about a brand, we can infuse that into our UI.

### How to Define a UI Brand's Voice and Tone

Voice and tone are connected to language usage and how you speak to your user through your UI. They are adjectives and implement themselves throughout the user's experience.

### Walk through the Brand Voice Matrix template and example 

- Start with a matrix of words and adjectives that help focus on you brand's position.

- Language usage spans the range from what to do to what not to do with a word.

  - For example, consider the adjective "youthful." 
      - Definition: To act young and have a lot of energy. 
      - Do: Feel relevant and responsive to what is hip and cool.
      - Do not: Appear amateurish or trying too hard to fit in.

- Fill out the adjectives that you think represent your government agencies. We'll map these words to images to help create the "brand prism."

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, you will be responsible for addressing the needs of a brand and getting the voice of a UI to match a brand. This is a nuanced skill desired by many recruiters. Add UX writing or UI voice and tone to your resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

### Review the Brand Identity Prism

Quickly go over the brand identity prism template as students will be practicing this on their own. Make sure students are with you before moving on to each section.

1. Physique - What your brand is made of through materials.
2. Personality - How your brand is personified.
3. Culture (values) - What your brand cares about.
4. Self-image - How your brand helps you users.
5. Reflection - How your brand portrays its users.
6. Relationship - How a brand connects with its audience and the type of relationship it wants to build is entirely up to that brand.

### Review the Apple Macintosh Brand Identity Prism Sample

- Walk through each section and pause to see if students have questions.

Now that students have learned how brand voice and tone are defined, as well as seen a few examples of the voice and tone of successful brands, it's time for them to experience it hands-on. In the following activity, students will craft the voice and tone for their government agency, using a matrix as a guide.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for any questions before jumping into practicing creating a brand voice.

## 10. Student Do: Brand Voice and Tone Matrix Activity (20 min)

**TAs,** slack out the following activity files and read the instructions:

- [09-Week/02-Activities/09.3/09.3-03-Brand-Voice-Analysis-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o6Vst-nWXmZPPFb9iXyts4rUj7r1A-PJ12NwrkT4YYA).

- [09.3-03-Brand-Voice-Analysis-Identity-Figma-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/ZRKdkyHaoKGGQsSoBdRwrk/09.3-03-Brand-Voice-Analysis-Identity-Template)

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor students and offer help to those who are stuck.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Group students who are working on the same government agency into Zoom breakout rooms in groups of two to four people. Assign TAs to the groups. (Tip: TAs can reference the agency selection template in order to establish these student groupings.) If students need more activity time, you can reduce the review time.

**Summary**

This activity pushes students deeper into their brands and encourages them to define a voice and tone using a brand voice matrix.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Help students pick out a few adjectives first before moving on to the more complicated brand identity prism.

*For students who finish early*: Teams can always iterate their statements or write more and vote as a team. Encourage iteration rather than stopping once they finish.

**Instructions**

Students should complete this activity with their teammates working on the same government agency.

- In Part 1, complete the brand voice and tone matrix.
  - Students will complete the first two tabs of the matrix spreadsheet.
  - Students will identify adjectives for their brand and when to use them.
- In Part 2, complete the brand identity prism.
  - Students will complete the third tab of the matrix spreadsheet if there's time.
  - Invite students to complete this portion at home if they do not complete it in class.

**Deliverable**

Students will share their completed brand voice and tone matrices and brand identity prisms via Slack.

## 11. Instructor Do: Brand Voice and Tone Matrix Activity Review (10 min)

Call attention back to the front of the class to lead a review of the brand matrices.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Aim to review the work of two to three groups.

- Have everyone share their brand voice and tone matrices below their brand statement in Slack.

- Select a group:
  - Have them read through their adjectives.
  - Review similarities and differences.
  - Quickly discuss how gathering samples and using those samples is a big part of their challenge and their UI practice.

- **Ask,** "*How much attention do you think your user pays to a brand's voice and tone?*"

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about brand voice and tone. For example:

  - "A UI's voice is not as important as an ad campaign." *False.* Your user doesn't distinguish a difference between the advertisement and the product. If anything, your ability to keep a consistent tone from marketing through to the UI will help keep your users happy.

  - "Voice and tone is a copywriter's job." *True but False.* It is very likely that you will work with a copywriter. However, as the UX/UI designer, you need to make sure there is collaboration and the attitude that "it's not my job" will create problems down the road when your UX writing ends up in ad campaigns or in marketing materials.

This wraps up Part 3 of today's lesson, a discussion of brand voice and tone. Students have achieved another learning objective, crafting a brand voice and tone matrix—be sure to acknowledge this milestone.

Next, the final part of today's lesson will be to discuss iconography and style tiles. This is the fine detail or "icing on the cake" of brand design. This will also give students the knowledge they need to fulfill their final learning objective of the day, which is creating a style tile for their government agency.

## 12. Instructor Do: Iconography and UI Style Tiles (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is for students to execute their brand direction, voice, and tone into visuals. This lecture supports today's third *and* fourth learning objectives, the do's and don'ts of brand voice and, especially, creating a UI style tile for an online brand.

At this point, students have gained an appreciation for how visuals, writing, voice, and tone each help shape a brand. Now let's look at one final element: iconography. Icons are tiny compared to other brand elements, but they're equally powerful.

- Icons are an important part of a UI and how a style guide communicates.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UI designer, you will need to visualize brand decisions and potentially create or maintain a style guide on the job. Being able to show this design deliverable in your portfolio will go a long way in helping you get a job.

### Introduce Iconography

Iconography is defined as the traditional or conventional images or symbols associated with a subject or idea, typically used for religion-based visuals.

We'll cover *iconography in the UI,* which is defined as the little graphic visuals that represent features, behaviors, or components of your user interface.

Share the basics so that students can dive deeper and practice the design concepts at home.

- Review where and when to use iconography.

  - **When:** UI iconography design is used throughout the process. All interfaces are learned, and icons are essential to making interfaces more usable.

  - **Why:** Iconography helps your user define context and improves recognition. Iconography can communicate complicated concepts through recognizable visuals that take up small amounts of space.

- Iconography is enormously important in the UI world.

  - Iconography helps us navigate our world (e.g., airports, trains, cities, etc.).

- Generally, an icon is 44px x 44px.

- **TAs:** Share the Apple human interface guidelines for students to read at home. They should study them so they can design more complex UI systems:

  - [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)

- Review icon styling and consistent voice.

  - Icons require consistency in size and presentation.

- These design tips are a lot to absorb quickly, but you'll work with UI type for the rest of this boot camp as well as throughout your UX/UI careers. Continue internalizing these concepts and discovering their uses in the wild.

> **Instructor Note:** Share an icon that is your personal favorite or you love using (e.g., the share icon or the camera icon).

### Ideograms, Pictograms, and Logomarks

We'll cover more iconography foundations.

- Icons come in many forms.

**Review Ideograms.**

An ideogram is a graphic symbol representing work or an idea.

- It is used when space prohibits using the fuller text version and universal design solutions are required (e.g., international airports and railway stations).
  - Iconography is vital for defining a system.
  - It should maintain consistent in design and graphic representation.
  - It assists in branding and communication.
  - It is a pivotal piece in universal design.
  - It should be tested for accessibility and usability.

**Review Pictograms.**

A pictogram is also called a pictogramme, pictograph, or picto, and in computer usage, an icon. A pictorial ideogram resembles a physical object or action.
  - Iconography is vital for defining a system.
  - It should maintain consistent in design and graphic representation.
  - It assists in branding and communication.
  - It is a pivotal piece in universal design.
  - It should be tested for accessibility and usability.

**Review Logomarks.**

A logomark is a character or symbol representing a word, phrase, or organization.
  - It is a graphical symbol used to represent a brand and to promote products and services.

**Review logo and logotype.**

A logo is a mark that represents a brand (e.g., the Nike Swoosh).
  - A logotype is a logo centered around a company name or initials (e.g., Nike).
  - It is specific to industry and application.

### Introduce Icon Interaction and Usability

Iconography is used to reinforce IA.
- Considerations include categories, navigation, sizing, features, controls, applications, etc.
- Icons should be taken seriously and applied equally across your UI design system.
- Consider icons that can communicate to all users, not just to those who already use or know of your products.

### Review the Communication Goals of the Icons

- Easily touched
- Compact and small
- Fast to recognize
- Language agnostic
- Aesthetic
- Reinforce the design system

Emphasize that there are lots of resources for icons.

  - **TAs,** slack out these resources:
    - [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - [https://icons8.com/](https://icons8.com/)
    - [https://thenounproject.com/](https://thenounproject.com/)

- Recommend any others, and note that we'll be using Font Awesome later in the development section of the course.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UI designer, you will work with iconography systems or be responsible for creating them internally on a team. Showing your ability to use these UI systems consistently and effectively for usable and useful systems will help you when applying for jobs. Add iconography development to you resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

- There are many resources. A good book is *Branded Interactions: Creating the Digital Experience*, by Marco Spies.

  - **TAs,** slack out: [https://www.brandedinteractions.com/](https://www.brandedinteractions.com/).

- The UI is talking to multiple users at once, and there is a lot to consider, but practice your icon usage. Testing them with your users is essential.

### Walk through the UI Style Tiles tool snapshot

**What is a UI style tile?**

A one-page, bite-size design guide that includes fonts, colors, and interface elements. Style tiles capture the essence of brand visuals in a condensed form.

- Designers refer to the work of others to make their work easy, and so can you. Building a robust style guide starts with a simple UI style tile template.

Style tiles are a great exercise in visual design and will help you to get to grips with how things like colors, shapes, and various other assets mingle together in your designs.

**When do designers use a UI style tile?**

- Developing as a starting place before defining any high-fidelity prototypes or mock-up screen executions.
- Develop and produce with the help of visual designers to establish rules and consistency within a UI.

**Why do we use a UI style tile?**

- A UI style tile allow for experimentation.
- Can help build cohesion and consistency to a digital product’s UI and experience.
- Style tiles are easily shareable and quick to produce.

### Ingredients of a UI Style Tile

- Color
- Typography
- Button styles
- Shape and layout
- Photography or illustration
- Iconography

Don't worry about only briefly discussing UI style tiles, as students will learn more about style tiles during the next activity.

We'll take the design concepts we just discussed and start using them in the world of website and UI design. Students will work in teams to gather and design iconography sets for their brands.

## 13. Student Do: UI Style Tile Challenge Activity (30 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity and read the instructions:

- [09-Week/02-Activities/09.3/09.3-04-UI-Style-Tile-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mlHelGzPm9-Vo3JaxzxoVU5c7neJa1PeDJ6pGiH__fQ)

- [09-Week/02-Activities/09.3/09.3-04-XD-UI-Style-Tile-Template-Resource](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HnfxorS-OT9IiNaqfSzmlgKGtJH3Sd4b)

- [09.3-04-UI-Style-Tile-Figma-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/ZN7NY8mQBm8ig1PyDAvjiP/09.3-04-UI-Style-Tile-Template)

**Instructor and TAs:** Be sure to circulate and suggest ways that students can enhance, arrange, and design their UI style tiles. Encourage them to have *fun.*

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students work individually, rather than in groups. Keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. If students need more time, you can shorten the review.

**Summary**

This activity gives students practice with UI style tiles by gathering and designing iconography for their government website.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Help students start with the template and work on adding things they have already made decision about. Their color palette, their logo, etc.

*For students who finish early*: Shouldn't be an issue, but this style tile is also part of the challenge so progress in class will reduce work at home. Encourage iteration.

**Instructions**

While working in groups of two to three, students are going to create a UI style tile in Figma/Adobe XD that includes a color palette, typography, images and patterns, and icons/iconography.

**Deliverable**

Students will submit their UI style tile as a .png export of their Figma/Adobe XD artboard.

## 14. Instructor Do: UI Style Tile Challenge Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention and lead a review of students' UI style tiles.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Aim to review the work of two to four groups.
- Ask students to explain their rationale behind their design choices.
- Open the room for feedback on the students' work.
  - *What works well?*
  - *What could have been done differently?*

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about UI style tiles. For example:

  - "A UI style title is the only way to create a style guide." *False.* There are literally endless ways to design a style guide, but why work so hard! Using templates and tools to speed up your decision-making is essential to being good at your job.

  - "UI style tiles aren't helpful when actually designing" *False.* Style tiles can be helpful in speeding up your experimentation and layout executions rather than always designing from scratch. Do not design from scratch for every screen—it's far too slow!

This wraps up your lesson for today—congratulations! You covered a lot of material.

Students have achieved their final learning objective of the day, creating a style tile for their government agency site. Before you begin office hours, quickly recap the key concepts students learned today.

## 15. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (10 min)

In the remaining time, lead the class in an active recall exercise of key concepts. This will help students retain what they've learned.

Give students two minutes to post their answers in chat. Encourage everyone to post answers! After, call on a few students to verbally provide answers and discuss any questions that arise. 

- Q: What are UI style guides and what are their role in UI?
  - A: UI style guides are the rules of product design that define how visuals are kept consistent among team members.
- Q: What are the key elements of a brand positioning statement?
  - A: The category in which the brand operates, the target audience, the benefit to the customers, and the reason why the brand will deliver on this promise.
- Q: What are examples of brand voice and tone?
  - A: Example: "At Mailchimp, we’ve walked in our customers' shoes, and we know marketing technology is a minefield of confusing terminology. That’s why we speak like the experienced and compassionate business partner we wish we’d had way back when."
- Q: When and why do designers create UI style tiles?
  - A: A UI style tile is the first version of a large set of UI components. Therefore, it is created at the beginning of the UI design process.

Ask one student from each group to share answers. Listen for clues that reveal only partial understanding of concepts. If time allows, clarify weak concepts on the spot, or invite students to stay for office hours.

Encourage students to use today's lesson and activities as jumping-off points for continued learning. To become successful designers, they must practice these skills. For example, students should practice writing another brand positioning statement, work on their brand voice and tone matrices, and do further iterations on their style tiles.

Ask if there are any questions. Remind students to take advantage of office hours, as you'll be able to address lengthy questions and demonstrate concepts.

- Remember, office hours are for the next 30 minutes.

Thank the students for their participation and wish everyone a good night.
