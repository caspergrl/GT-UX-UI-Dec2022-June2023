# 9.1 Lesson Plan: UI Information Architecture and Hierarchy

---

## Overview

Today's class will introduce students to the fundamentals of effective information architecture (IA), which is essential to successful web design. UI designers analyze then organize information in a clear, logical way so that users can process it easily.

In Lesson 9.2, you will introduce UI design systems, card sorting, sitemaps, and navigation. You'll also walk students through a card sorting exercise, reviewing how to structure information logically, and discussing how to apply card sorting to IA and navigation schemes. In Lesson 9.3, you'll cover the fundamentals of UI design branding, and students will learn about UI style guides, brand positioning statements, brand voice, and iconography. As a whole, Unit 9 enables students to evaluate logical information categories, create usable UI navigation systems, and practice applying information design strategies to a webpage prototype.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Articulate the logic of information and organize content using the LATCH principles (location, alphabet, time, category, and hierarchy).
2. Analyze and identify a website's IA components as well as its principles.
3. Design site content in Figma based on an IA analysis and apply content chunking.
4. Practice wireframing with content chunking in Figma.

## Class at a Glance

Welcome to Lesson 9.1 on UI IA and hierarchy. Today's lesson has three parts:
- Part 1 introduces IA and the LATCH method for organization.
- Part 2 covers categorization and hierarchy.
- Part 3 shows students how to analyze IA and apply principles and content hierarchy to redesign a webpage's information (i.e., content chunking).

By the end of today's class, students should know how to analyze IA and understand how it affects UI design decisions.

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: 🌐) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activities and reviews by doing the activity as a class instead of creating breakout groups.  

> **Instructor Note:** If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Prepare for Class

Review the slides for the lecture: [09-Week/01-Slides/09.1 Information Architecture and Hierarchy Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b6nXuEWdwrAeUMxGyuXMpTwwwKNVRuogZB0jxV9Y2ag/edit?usp=sharing).

Be sure to read through the entire lesson plan, slides, student activity files, and the Time Tracker—and make notes so that you’re thoroughly prepared to teach and support students.

***Remember, Unit 9 is a demanding week and you'll cover a large volume of content.***
- ***Make this lesson more manageable in the classroom:***
    - Break up the class into three large groups for activities and reviews. Take one group and have the teaching assistants (TAs) take the other two.

Practice this lesson's demos in advance so they run smoothly during class:

  - Figma UI Annotation Demo (Section 11)

  - InVision Freehand Demo (Section 12)

Prepare to engage with your students' progress. Be sure to:
  - Work with your TAs to help students
  - Pay close attention to students' individual needs
  - Encourage the use of office hours for challenge assistance and feedback.
  - Share UI resources and encourage students to practice often.

## Office Hours: Reviews and Practice (45 min before class)

> **Instructor Note:** Encourage your students to make the most out of class and not to be afraid to ask questions.
>
> - Do your part by engaging students.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Today's Objectives (3 min)

- Open up the slides for the lecture: [09-Week/01-Slides/09.1 Information Architecture + Hierarchy Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b6nXuEWdwrAeUMxGyuXMpTwwwKNVRuogZB0jxV9Y2ag/edit?usp=sharing).

  - **TAs:** Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.

- Remind students to adopt a "boot camp mindset"—they should expect a fast pace with a lot of information coming at them. Tell students the following:
  - UI design will get harder as you layer new skills on top of those acquired from the UX lessons. Don't worry, though. We're here to help you gain these skills. Your growth will be astounding, but it will take work.
  - Our abilities and backgrounds vary, and IA concepts are hard. It's unlikely students will have prior experience or master's degrees in library science. So most of you will need to practice at home and pursue independent reading and research.
  - The content is complex so it can be hard to master. For a site design to work, UI design tools must be used effectively, efficiently, and at scale. Successful UI depends on proven execution strategies and requires consideration of all aspects of a system. Websites hold hundreds of pages, with users accessing them from multiple screens, from mobile to desktop.

**Review today's objectives with the class.**

- Connect today's learning to the UX skills students learned in the first part of the boot camp, showing how they connect and add dimension to where we are now. For example:

  - Caring about your user means applying organizational principles to the content they'll consume on a website.
  - Prototyping and testing an IA will help design a usable navigation system.
  - Considering your users' needs bears on designing and applying information logic, content chunking, and UI usability.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Drawing on your experience, share effective study techniques and methods for processing large volumes of information.
>
> - Have a TA share their own experience with setting themselves up for success—what worked and what didn't.

- > **Say:** "We've got your back if the learning and work become overwhelming!" Suggest these strategies:
  - Use office hours before and after class. Like, really use them.
  - Form study groups outside of class to support one another.
  - Take good notes and, after class, *actively* review and annotate them to reinforce the lesson and fill in gaps.
    - **TAs,** slack out: [http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/](http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/)
- Remind students to keep up on their challenge.
  - Challenge one another.
  - Students can practice UI tools with DailyUI: [https://www.dailyui.co/](https://www.dailyui.co/).

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Have two or three students briefly share their best practices for remembering concepts and progressing through the boot camp.

## 2. Instructor Do: IA and LATCH Principles (15 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to define IA and teach students the LATCH approach to UI design. This lecture supports today's first learning objective, articulating the logic behind applying LATCH principles.

During Week 8, we analyzed a website through the lens of usability. In Week 9, we'll learn how to analyze websites through the lens of IA to improve usability.

### Introduce IA

IA is the science of organizing and structuring the content of websites, web and mobile applications, and social media software.

> ***IA helps people find the content they’re looking for without too much effort***.

> **Say:** "IA was UX before UX was a thing."

- UX has been a recognized profession since 2005. In contrast, the information architect occupation emerged in the 1990s, after the birth of the modern internet.

>  **Instructor Note:** IA encompasses all the techniques designers use to understand the underlying structure of sites and apps. The output is a blueprint, or diagram, of the structure of a site or app. Once a designer can see that structure, they can create wireframes and sitemaps.

Think of an IA blueprint as a car diagram, showing the complex structure of the systems and their interworking components.

:gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask two or three students to suggest other types of diagrams that organize things and make them easy to navigate—this should help them grasp the concept.

- The art and science of IA began in the 1970s, long before the rise of the web, mobile apps, or popular UX design. Its roots are found in numerous fields that UX practitioners draw on, including library science, cognitive psychology, and architecture.

Review **IA**: IA is the art and science of organizing and labeling information for websites, intranets (confined networks), online communities, and software to support usability and learning. It brings principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape.

### Why Does IA Matter?

A well-thought-out IA is critical to good user experiences.

- For example, if we compare a retail website to a blog, we’ll see two different structures to accomplish their respective objectives. IA has become a fundamental study in many spheres, including design and software development.

- IA makes it easier for people who create and maintain content to do their jobs. IA links content so that it is easy to find and useful. Content includes text, images, videos, documents, forum discussions, and contact information.

### The Information Architect

IA preceded the UX designer.

- Consider the responsibilities listed in information architect job postings.

- An information architect generally performs various activities as part of a UX project team. Everyday tasks include research, navigation creation, wireframing, labeling, and data modeling. IA tasks follow a process to create logic and structure. Deliverables include visualizations, such as sitemaps for hierarchy or tag clouds for text data.

### Review the Context for Using IA

- When do we use IA? IA is foundational to building UI, websites, and software. Users consume and interact with content (information).

- Why do we use IA? IA is essential in considering a user's needs. As the volume of information grows, UX/UI designers must apply logic and structure to manage that data.

### Review the Spotify Case Study

If you want clean, focused design, you have to start with clean, focused IA. It forces us to think, so our users don’t have to.

- When we use IA principles to evaluate the structure of an app, the process forces us to view the app objectively. Not as a collection of related pages and images but as abstract constructs (e.g., nouns and verbs, rather than full sentences). We quickly see that the app is just information. The way we piece that information together determines how well a user can navigate and consume it.

- Take Spotify, for example. We can deconstruct the UI to reveal the underlying IA. Using an iOS device to view the screen, we first notice the tab bar, a core component of iOS that is essential to the page's IA. The tab bar includes four primary tabs: Home, Browse, Radio, and Your Library. From each page, we can break down all of the separate pages for a rough output of the IA.

>:gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a personal experience using IA in your daily practice.

- Review some high-level goals for IA.

> **Instructor Note:** Don't worry about moving fast. Remind students to continue to dive deeper at home if they don't know some of these principles.

### IA Goals

- Findable
- Accessible
- Clear
- Controllable
- Communicative
- Usable
- Credible
- Learnable

### LATCH Organizing Scheme Principles

When you're tasked with organizing information, the options might seem endless. After all, there are infinite possibilities for designing anything. However, when it comes to organizing information, there are only five ways to do it.

### Read Richard Saul Wurman's Quote

Richard Saul Wurman is an American architect, graphic designer, and a founder of the IA field.

### Walk Through Each Letter of LATCH

- **Location:**
  - Creating a map is a common way to organize by location (e.g., shopping mall directories or college campus maps).

- **Alphabet:**
  - Websites often run long menus in alphabetical order, which can prove problematic. If the user doesn't understand the website's terms, alphabetizing content won't help the situation. There are times, however, when ordering alphabetically suits the user's needs. For example, a user can navigate a list of novels when sorted by the author's last name. It's not as useful for a list of reference books, which would be better organized by the Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress classification systems.

- **Time:**
  - Organizing by time linearly shows activities over some time. Consider a flow chart that describes a process (e.g., making chicken nuggets) from beginning to end. Organizing by time tells a very different story about information, such as revealing a chronological pattern. For example, the calendar view in Slide 18 maps the number of times the Wayback Machine crawled ESPN's content between December 11, 1997, and May 10, 2019.

- **Category:**
  - The foods listed in Slide 19 are organized by category, a useful method for sorting nearly anything (e.g., color, shape, gender, model, price, etc.).

- **Hierarchy:**
  - Hierarchies are used in organizational charts to show who reports to whom. Hierarchy is also used to show scale (e.g., biggest to smallest or heaviest to lightest).

- Remind students to memorize the LATCH acronym, as all information is organized by one of these methods.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions on IA or LATCH.

- Finally, engage the class in a quick game of active recall: Ask students to name the method represented by each letter of LATCH (e.g., "Who can tell me what the 'L' in LATCH stands for?”).

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation: **Have students share their answers in the Zoom chat or Slack.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Your ability to describe why UI decisions are made is what an employer is looking for. Describing IA logic using LATCH will shine through in your UI decision making.

### Review the Organization Schemes Tool Snapshot

**What are organization schemes?**

An organization scheme defines the shared characteristics of content and influences the logical grouping of those items. An organization structure defines the types of relationships between content items and groups.

**When do designers use organization schemes?**

· When an information architect is working organizing and establishing content hierarchy.

· During navigation usability testing and designs useful UI.

· When a UX/UI designer is organizing content and information.

**Why do we use organization schemes?**

· Your user is looking for content to be structure and organized in a meaningful matter.

· To make your content more consumable and thus more usable.

· To meet your users’ needs of logical and clear structure.

Now that students grasp the concept of IA and the principles of LATCH, it's time for them to put that knowledge into practice. In the following activity, students will get a feel for how designers work with LATCH principles.

## 3. Student Do: LATCH Analysis Activity (15 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity:
[09-Week/02-Activities/09.1/09.1-01-LATCH-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i-__P9mAXha6vGU8JG15IJ1BVS8uEsecUE03c9T9lEU)

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor the students and offer to help those who are stuck or have questions. Be sure the pairs are working well together.

**Summary**

This activity gives students practice with applying LATCH principles to their work and analyzing the organizing principles of websites while using Figma to document their work.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Work with students to start on one navigation drop-down before exploring an entire navigation system of Craigslist. If students continue to struggle, have them attend office hours for extra help and pair them with another student who is not struggling.

*For students who finish early*: Have them conduct internet research into LATCH and Richard Saul Wurman and share in Slack.

**Instructions**

For Part 1 of this activity, students will pair up and identify the organizing principle of Craigslist.org pages according to LATCH principles.

For Part 2, students will work in their government agency groups of two or three and identify the organizing principles of their government agency webpages according to the LATCH principles. 

For Part 3, students will share their work in Slack.

For each part, they’ll use Figma to annotate and present their findings.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Gather students who are working on the same government agency into Zoom breakout rooms. The TAs can reference the agency selection template to establish these student groupings. Group sizes should be a minimum of two and a maximum of three students. Break up bigger government agency groups into more breakout rooms. Assign TAs to Zoom breakout rooms to assist students. If students need more activity time, reduce the review time.

**Deliverables**

Students will submit two screenshots showing annotated webpages for both Craigslist.org and their government agency website.

## 4. Instructor Do: LATCH Analysis Activity Review (10 min)

Call attention back and make sure everyone has placed their Craigslist content into Slack.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Aim to review two to four students' work.
- Review the student examples:
  - Call on a student and ask which LATCH principle he or she used.
  - **Ask,** "Why did you choose this LATCH principle?"
  - Launch the webpage.

Let students know we're exploring how to mature a UI through usability. We want to make their UIs as usable and useful as possible.

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they apply LATCH principles. For example:

  - Craigslist is not a beacon of great design, but if their information logic were not clear it would be impossible to use their website. Making things usable has much more value to your user than making them "pretty."
  - Choose an information logic (e.g., alphanumeric) and stick with it. It is not recommended to switch from alphabet to hierarchy in the same experience.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about the LATCH concept. For example:

  - "Users don't care what order their navigation is in." *False.* Information logic should map to the users' expectations.
  - "LATCH is too simplistic." *False.* Information can be highly complex, but our approach to organization should not overcomplicate the information.

We have wrapped up the first part of today's lesson, introducing IA and applying LATCH principles, which fulfills the first learning objective.

The next stop on today's tour includes IA components and principles.

## 5. Instructor Do: IA Components and Principles (15 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to define IA components and principles and get students thinking about information systems for their UI. This supports today's second learning objective, the ability to analyze and identify the IA components and principles of a website.

Now that students have a sense of IA as it relates to the LATCH principles, let's jump into the four essential components of IA and the three principles of IA. You'll guide students through a brief lecture on taxonomy and follow with an activity.

Help students grasp the value of the components and principles you're about to cover. Relate it to learning about the Gestalt laws: understanding IA components and principles gives us a new way of seeing how users see.

### IA Components

An information architect is an expert in information (content), when that content is used (context), and how that content provides value to a user (usability/accessibility). These IA components determine the relationships among content, context, and users.

Review IA's four essential components:

1. **Organization systems/schemes and structures** refer to how users categorize information.
2. **Labeling systems** pertain to how users represent information.
3. **Navigation systems** relate to how users browse through information.
4. **Searching systems** concern how users look for and find information.

**TAs,** slack out the following links:

- [https://www.amazon.com/Information-Architecture-World-Wide-Web-ebook/](https://www.amazon.com/Information-Architecture-World-Wide-Web-ebook/dp/B0043D2E68)
- [https://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Sense-Any-Mess/](https://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Sense-Any-Mess/dp/1500615994/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415130655&sr=8-1&keywords=how%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20any%20mess)

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to share how they think about these four components.
>
> - The idea is to help students connect theory and practice—they **will** need this knowledge on the job.

#### Organization Systems

 There are three main organizational structures—hierarchical, sequential, and matrix.

- **Hierarchical:**
  - Visual hierarchy is a well-known technique of content organization. Initially based on Gestalt psychological theory, the primary goal of hierarchy is to present content on the carrier—be it a book, poster, webpage, or mobile screen. Hierarchy allows users to understand the level of importance for each element by establishing a visual priority.

- **Sequential:**
  - This structure creates a path for users. Information design can assist a user in going step by step through content to accomplish the task. Sequential information is used for retail websites or apps, where people have to go from one task to another to make the purchase.

- **Matrix:**
  - This type is a bit more complicated for users, since they choose the path of navigation on their own. In a typical design organized by a matrix, users interact with an interface that has multiple options of equal weight. Users are given choices of content organization.

#### Labeling Systems

Labeling systems are how designers represent information. Product design requires simplicity; too much information can confuse users because it forces them to consume content that might not be relevant to their task. This is commonly referred to as the signal/noise problem. Simplicity creates the clearest signal of an interface possible. That’s why designers create labels that represent loads of data in a few words.

- For example, when designers give the contact information of the company on the website, it usually includes the phone number, email, and social media contacts. However, designers can’t present all of this information on the landing page. The “Contact Us” triggers the realization of a labeling system for that information.

#### Navigation Systems

Navigation is the set of actions and techniques guiding users through the app or website, enabling them to fulfill their goals and successfully interact with the product. The navigation system involves the ways users move through the content.

- For example, there are multiple ways to navigate the content on *The Washington Post* website.

#### Searching Systems

This system is used in IA to help users find data within a digital product like a website or an app. Searching systems, including search bars, filters, tagging, and views, are useful for products with a lot of information that a user could get lost in.

- For example, there are multiple ways to search or filter content on *The Washington Post* website.

### IA Principles

Walk through the three IA principles, known as "the gears of IA":

1. **Ontology:** the particular meaning of information.
2. **Taxonomy:** the arrangement of information.
3. **Choreography:** the movement and interaction of parts of information.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how these IA principles show up in your own work to help students connect what they're learning to the real world. Alternatively, invite a TA to share.

#### Ontology

Ontology is the establishment of particular meanings. We often forget to take a step back and ask how our use of language implies a specific meaning to us but could be confusing to others. Richard Saul Wurman says that it can be useful for designers to “understand what it’s like to not understand.” Even simple words and concepts, like “orange,” can have unhelpfully subjective meanings.

- For example, what kind of “orange” is orange? In this case, the Pantone company created a unique, specific identifier for this particular color of orange. Its meaning is unmistakable, and this color is unique from any other color or any different definition of this word, like a piece of fruit.

#### Taxonomy

Taxonomy is the arrangement of the parts to accomplish specific goals within or across contexts. This is the principle that is most commonly identified as “information architecture,” meaning to structure information in the form of taxonomies, sitemaps, or wireframes. However, the forms are only useful once the meaning of the underlying system has been identified. Moreover, given the complex and contradictory nuances of meaning between businesses and their customers, the structures for ensuring its integrity across channels need to be both precise and adaptable.

- For example, the color orange may be defined as "Pantone 1505 C," but taxonomically, it can belong both under "Interior Paints" and "Paint Samples" if that is the context where the user needs it.

#### Choreography

Choreography is the set of rules for interaction among the parts. This part of IA deals with how meaning and structure fit together. Choreography ensures that the flow of an experience delights the user and doesn’t distract from what the user is trying to do. The essence of choreography is the placement of meaning and structure into a flow with a specific context.

- Choreography questions on Pantone 1505 C might include:
  - Does the experience surrounding Pantone 1505 C change if the user is on a tablet?
  - Why did the user choose to use a tablet instead of a desktop computer?
  - What if the user is in Home Depot's paint aisle?
  - During the process of choosing a paint, when does the user select Pantone 1505 C? What does the user first have to know about painting?
  - Does the user choose the finish (flat, eggshell, gloss, etc.) first or last?
  - What about pairing other colors?

- These issues are at the core of choreography, which is essential to successful user experiences. When multiple devices and applications are involved, not to mention a large number of underlying systems that provide the content, the choreography is critical.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Your ability to effectively discuss how your UI solutions apply ontology, taxonomy, and choreography will help you appear more professional during job interviews. You'll have an advantage if you can speak with authority about your solutions during job interviews.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions.

**Read Donna Spencer's quote:** Donna Spencer is an information architect and the UX author of *A Practical Guide to Information Architecture*.

- **TAs,** slack out the following:
  - [uxpodcast.com](http://www.uxpodcast.com)
  - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw2nQLVGBGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw2nQLVGBGE)

Now that students know the IA components and principles, delve deeper into taxonomy to prepare for an activity.

## 6. Instructor Do: Taxonomy (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to define taxonomy and to have students consider logic when applying language to a UI.

We'll dig deeper into taxonomy, the second IA principle. Taxonomy is not straightforward, so we'll give it extra attention. Start by reviewing what students remember from a few moments ago (recall reinforces learning).

### Taxonomy

- Who can define taxonomy? (Answer: Taxonomy is a hierarchical structure for the classification or organization of data.)

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students share their answers in the Zoom chat or Slack.

- Ask, "Has anyone heard of the mnemonic device 'Dear King Philip Came Over For Good Soup'"?
  - The first letter of each word reminds us of the order of taxa in biology: **D**omain, **K**ingdom, **P**hylum, **C**lass, **O**rder, **F**amily, **G**enus, and **S**pecies.

> :gem: **Student Insight:** Ask two students for a mnemonic device they know. (Sharing one that you know may help them remember.)

### Review the Information Categorization Tool Snapshot

**What is information categorization?**  

Information categorization is an activity that consists of putting things (objects, ideas, people) into relationships. The task of supervised classification involves extracting information from the labeled examples that allows accurate prediction of class labels of future.

**When do designers use information categorization?** 

· When an information architect is working on sitemaps

· When a Use interface designer is working on navigation.

· When a UX/UI designer is organizing content and information.

**Why do we use information categorization?** 

· Information can be dense with a lot of content. IA and UI create logic and test it with users to see if it makes sense.

· To make your content more consumable and thus more usable.

· To meet your users’ needs of logical and clear relationships.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause and ask if students have any questions. Wait 30 seconds for questions to arise.

We've covered IA components and principles and expanded on taxonomy. Students have achieved the second learning objective, which is analyzing and identifying IA components and principles on a website.

After a break, students will learn content chunking—what it is, how to see it, and how to apply it to a design.

## 7. Break (10 min)

It's time to take a break.  


After the break, students will learn about content inventory and content chunking. You'll also demo how to mark up and annotate a UI and how to use freehand in preparation for redesigning a site.


> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Don't stop sharing your screen. Put up a Google timer or a YouTube timer video to help get students back into the Zoom room on time.

## 8. Instructor Do: Content Inventory and Content Chunking (20 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to have students analyze a UI and consider the parts and how they're organized, which addresses the third and fourth learning objectives. The third objective is to design site content in Adobe XD based on an IA analysis and to apply content chunking. The fourth objective is to practice wireframing with content chunking in Adobe XD.

Now go even deeper into IA, specifically on content inventory and chunking so students can start applying their new skills as information architects. Your lecture will prepare them for redesigning a site and chunking content.

After this, you'll give two demos, followed by a student activity and review.

### Content Inventory

The primary purpose of a content audit is to produce a spreadsheet listing the site’s content. Before pulling inventory, it’s important to note your goals and scope.

- **Goals:** Understanding why you’re doing the audit and what you intend to do with the results can help focus this activity and make it less overwhelming.

- **Scope:** It is important to determine which areas of the site or particular date ranges should be captured.

Once goals and scope are understood, you can choose which audit makes sense for you. Often audits are used to track:

- Which pages should be removed
- Whether content needs to be revised
- Which content needs to be written due to gaps
- Where content should be mapped to if being moved or if it requires redirects

### Three Types of Content Inventory

1. Full content inventory: A complete listing of every content item on the site. This may include all pages as well as all assets (such as downloadable files and videos).

   - Typically a job done by a content strategist.

2. Partial content inventory: A listing of a subset of the site’s content. A partial list might include the top few levels of a hierarchical site or the past six months of articles. All sections of the site will be covered.

3. Content sample: A less detailed collection of example content from the site.

Review the importance of content in the UX.

- Say: ***"It doesn't matter how good the content is—if the interface is awful, users won't stick around."***

### Review Markup Review

- As UI designers, we spend much time explaining how UX works.

- Likely, this will be one of your first tasks as a UX/UI designer, so pay attention to the details and show that you know what you're talking about.

### Content Chunking

Whether you have a website, presentation, mobile app, web application, or another UI, the principle of chunking information is relevant.

- UX definition: In the field of UX design, chunking usually refers to breaking up content into small, distinct units of information (or chunks), as opposed to presenting an undifferentiated mess of information.

### Review the Content Chunking Tool Snapshot

**What is content chunking?**

- Content chunking refers to the strategy of breaking down information into bite-sized pieces so your user can consume, memorize, or create focus. 
- Chunking content is critical because of how our brain works with storing information in short- and long-term memory.

**When do we use content chunking?**

- Content chunking is essential to UI in websites or software. Using design principles and elements of design will help inform the user.
- It works by presenting a large amount of content in small modules to make the information easier to read, process, and remember. 

>:gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to give an example of how they've used content chunking in their work.

Focus is something hard to capture these days—research shows that human attention spans have dropped to 8 seconds. [Source:  Time magazine/Microsoft Study 2015: https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/.]

**Why do we use content chunking?**

- Information can be dense with a lot of content. IA and UI create logic and test it with users to see if it makes sense.
- To make your content more consumable and usable. 
- To not overwhelm your user with information.

Content chunking is important to responsive web and component designs, especially as users want to view content on various screens. Responsive web design allows us to meet those demands.

- We'll go deeper into responsive web design during Units 10 and 11.

### Miller’s Law and Content Chunking

Breaking up information allows the brain to focus.

- Review the content chunking methods.

- In 1956, George Miller, an American psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist, asserted that the span of immediate memory and absolute judgment were both limited to around seven pieces of information.

- For example, a chunked phone number (+1-919-555-2743) is easier to remember (and scan) than a long string of unchunked digits (19195552743).

- Take questions and let students know we'll practice this skill next.

### Content Chunking Applies to UI Component Design

Component-based design is a practice of splitting UI into smaller, more manageable parts with clear names.

- A component can be anything that uses at least three UI elements.
UI components: Cards, Hero Spaces, Image Viewers, Video Players, and Navigation Menus.

### Content Chunking Organization

- Content is organized around a user’s interest.

- Establish your chunked content into cards.

### Content Chunking Example

- Review page top-down.

### Markup Review, Content Chunking, and Inventory Example

- Take questions and let students know we'll practice this skill next.

- Markup review will likely be one of your first tasks as a UX/UI designer, so pay attention to the details and show that you know what you're talking about.

- Take questions from students.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** The ability for students to analyze UI work and show how they can recognize UI/IA and UX principles could be a way to show an interviewer their skills. Analyzing UI work will likely be a deliverable a UX/UI designer does first on the job.

Students should now have a solid understanding of what content chunking is. They will get a chance to apply it *soon.*


## 9. Instructor Do: Demo - Figma Content Annotation (10 min)

  - Quickly walk students through the basics of marking up a UI and adding annotations.


> Briefly pause to take a few questions.

- Reviewing these design tools is a lot to accomplish quickly. Students can ask questions and learn while doing.
- They'll work with content and information structure for the rest of the boot camp and their UX/UI careers.
- Students should continue to internalize these ideas and look for them out in the real world. They should be acutely critiquing navigation titles, looking for and expecting clear organization, recognizing the use of taxonomy, and basking in great content chunking on their own.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Take a moment to check in with the class and see how comfortable they feel about the material covered.

- Stop sharing your screen for a moment and switch to gallery view in Zoom to see your class on one screen.
- Ask the class to use the Zoom meeting reactions found in the Meeting Controls panel at the bottom of the Zoom window to use the thumbs up 👍 or clap 👏 emojis if they're feeling comfortable and confident with the material you've covered so far.

Now, proceed with showing them how Freehand works in the next demo.

## 10. Instructor Do: Demo - InVision Freehand (5 min)

After this demo, students will spend half an hour on the next activity with support from you and the TAs.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Remind students that they're preparing to join a workforce that has been influenced by UX thinking. That workforce is collaborative and requires knowing the tools designers use. Explain to students that their ability to collaborate will make them hirable as well as successful on the job.

### Demo InVision Freehand

Quickly demo InVision Freehand's collaborative features. Ask your TAs to help share the feature and collaborate.

1. Open InVision. Create a new Freehand session.

   ![01-InVision-New-Freehand.png](Images/01-InVision-New-Freehand.png)

2. Skip the tutorial, but suggest students use it to learn the software.

   ![02-Tutorial-Walkthrough.png](Images/02-Tutorial-Walkthrough.png)

3. Invite your team members to join the Freehand.

   - Slack out the link to your TAs.

- **Ask,** "Any questions?"

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Take a moment to check in with the class and see how comfortable they feel about the material covered.

- Stop sharing your screen for a moment and switch to gallery view in Zoom to see your class on one screen.
- Ask the class to use the Zoom meeting reactions found in the Meeting Controls panel at the bottom of the Zoom window to use the thumbs up 👍 or clap 👏 emojis if they're feeling comfortable and confident with the material you've covered so far.

At last! Now it's time for students to practice working with the tools from your demo and to accomplish the final two learning objectives of the day.

## 11. Student Do: IA Analysis and Intervention Activity (30 min)

**TAs,** slack out the following Google Doc activity file (also in your class drive):
[09-Week/02-Activities/09.1/09.2-04-IA-Analysis-Intervention Activity](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19wp4F2tfLfu9u8khTsrdhF6gOOSrR-tZu7KM-p05dkI)

Slack out the Figma template [09.1-03-IA-Analysis-Intervention-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/SZpw1vr75nab3ejs6jb4ih/09.1-03-IA-Analysis-Intervention-Template)

**Instructor and TAs**

This is a long activity, so be sure to support students through the steps and assist them when they’re stuck. Monitor students and help out those struggling with Figma or InVision Freehand.

**Summary**

This activity provides practice with moving between Figma and InVision Freehand, applying IA analysis, and acting on that analysis by redesigning the page's IA aspects.

*Tips for students who struggle*: With a TA, join groups/breakout rooms to help students get into the tools quickly. Assign a group leader to help drive the activity.

*For students who finish early* (although unlikely): Groups can continue to discuss solutions and play with InVision Freehand.

**Instructions**

Students will work in groups for the first two parts and independently for part three. Students will begin by analyzing and annotating a page from their government agency site. Next, they'll use InVision Freehand to sketch out a solution, and finally design a solution in Adobe XD.

- For Part 1, take screenshots and determine the organizing principle (10 min).
- For Part 2, create a new InVision Freehand document (10 min).
- For Part 3, individually redesign the sketch using Adobe XD (10 min).

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Gather students who are working on the same government agency into Zoom breakout rooms. TAs can reference the agency selection template to establish these student groupings. Group size should be a minimum of two and a maximum of six students. Assign TAs to Zoom breakout rooms to assist students. If students need more activity time, reduce the review time. For each breakout room, assign a student as the leader, and have them share their InVision Freehand with the other activity members.

**Deliverable**

Students will share three items: (1) an annotated, marked up Figma board showing their analysis; (2) a Freehand sketch from InVision; and (3) their redesign from Figma.

## 12. Instructor Do: IA Analysis and Intervention Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention to review student work and discuss how it went for everyone.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Students should share the following in Slack:
  - InVision Freehand work
  - Figma prototypes
  - InVision links
- Call on three to five students to discuss their work.
- Talk about a few solutions as a group.

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they do an IA analysis. For example:

  - Look for the use of LATCH, if not used clearly, and recommend an information logic.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQ**s about IA analysis. For example:
  - "Sketching as a team is a waste of time." *False.* Design is a team sport; the ability to work as a group will be the difference between getting UX/UI work and not.
  - "Prototypes need to be high-fidelity to be useful to a team." *False.* Collaborative tools are more effective during ideation and sketching as there is more room for group experimentation.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask TAs to share ideas and observations that might be helpful to students the next time they work with Freehand and do UI markup and annotation.

We have wrapped up the third and final part of today's lesson, with students achieving the third and fourth learning objectives.

## 13. Instructor Do: Recap (5 min)

As a wrap-up, help students retain what they learned today with a recall exercise.

**Review concepts and reinforce learning.**

Spend a couple of minutes helping students anchor today’s learning. Ask them to raise their hands—or post answers in Slack—and offer definitions for the following concepts covered in today's class:

- What are IAs? (Answer: The structural elements of a site or app.)
- What does LATCH stand for? (Answer: location, alphabet, time, category, and hierarchy.)
- What are the four key IA components? (Answer: organization, labeling, navigation, and search systems.)
- What are the three IA principles? (Answer: ontology, taxonomy, and choreography.)
- What's an example of content chunking? (Answer: Chunking a phone number so that it is easier to remember.)
- Why is Freehand useful? (Answer: Freehand provides a collaborative space for teams to design in real time.)
- Why is marking up and annotating a UI useful? (Answer: Marking up and annotating enables designers to comment and leave contextual information.)

Tell students that they'll continue building on their information and UI content skills in Lesson 9.2.

## 14. Instructor Do: UI Units Project and Challenge Unit 9 (10 min)

Now that students have the skills, they can begin their challenge for this week.

Introduce Weekly Challenge Unit 9:

- Imagine you're a UI designer tasked with redesigning a government agency website because it is not readily usable or accessible. The task seems overwhelming, and you're likely wondering, "How do I know what to build? Where do I start?"

- This week you'll take on the role of an information architect by **iterating a user persona, applying heuristics, card sorting, building a sitemap, and creating navigation**.

- **Why do this?** So you can practice following the UI design process, best practices, and responsive design principles.

- **TAs,** slack out the challenge instructions to students:
[09-Week/04-Homework/01-Instructions/Unit 9 Homework](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KRKItxH2dbV6SXOtWcgRTezwJ03qaJwX1i-CxBmbsZU)

  - Remind students that they should add to their InVision prototypes and make progress on their weekly challenge.

- Remember, office hours are for the next 30 minutes.

- Take any remaining questions.
- Wish everyone a good night.
