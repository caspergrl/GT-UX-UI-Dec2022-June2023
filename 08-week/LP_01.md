# 8.1 Lesson Plan: UI Analysis and Design Fundamentals

## Overview

Today's class will introduce students to the fundamentals of user interface (UI) analysis and design.

We will continue to build on our students' abilities to infuse human-centered design into solving UI issues. By the end of today's lesson, students should have a grasp of visual design basics and how they relate to UI design decisions.

**Unit 8 as a whole:** This first lesson of Unit 8 introduces UI analysis and visual design elements and principles as a foundation for the next 16 weeks. The second lesson (8.2) will dive quickly into graphic design principles, teaching students to recognize good design and be able to identify which elements of design are in play. The final lesson (8.3) will round out the unit by covering typography and type styles, UI grids, and building grids in XD. All together, Unit 8 teaches students skills in visual design, allowing them to practice these skills throughout the remainder of the boot camp.

**The UI section of this boot camp:** Units 1-7 focused on user experience (UX) and design thinking. Over the next five weeks, Units 8-12 will focus on the UI design process.

**Important:** By the end of today, students must select a government agency website to redesign. There must be a minimum of two students per government website.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Analyze a UI by using the 10 usability heuristics and articulate usability issues that exist in UX.

2. Test a UI color palette representing the primary, secondary, and tertiary interaction hierarchy against color accessibility ratio guidelines and iterate the UI color palettes based on feedback.

3. Define how usability testing leads to UI patterns and recall 10 usability best practices for the web.

4. Identify, annotate, and mark up a website's UI patterns.

## Class at a Glance

Welcome to the UI Design Unit 8.1. 

Today's class covers UI analysis and usability diagnostic skills. It is divided into three parts.

- In Part 1, we'll talk about UI analysis for our government agency project and universal design.
- In Part 2, we'll define and practice usability heuristics and accessibility.
- In Part 3, students will explore UI best practices and UI patterns while defining UI patterns via InVision Boards.

Government agency project: Students will internalize the UI process by redesigning a website for a government agency, a project that will empower your students to master the fundamentals of UI design and responsive website design (RWD).

We provide a list of suggested government agencies for students to redesign. Alternatively, they can choose a local government website. Be sure students work on a government website and not a nonprofit, which will be the focus of a later group project.

**Challenge:** Design is fundamentally collaborative. For many of the challenge assignments in this lesson and the UI portion of the boot camp, students will work in pairs to share feedback and collaborate on complex tasks, such as UI heuristic analysis, card sorting, and prototype user testing.

**In-class activities:** In this lesson and the UI portion of the boot camp, students will continue activities at home to refine their work and practice UI concepts. 

You have many weeks to work with these students, and their progress will astound you. Buckle in! You're in for a fun ride!

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: 🌐) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

🌐**Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activity and review sections by doing activites as a class instead of creating breakout groups. 

## Preparing for Class

- Review the slides before the lecture: [08-Week/01-Slides/08.1-UI Analysis and Design Fundamentals Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1swjj9baKtl4Y-vDcKp6TbhcThQGO9lZGL-UD4ILCN1E).

- Look over the list of government agencies.

  - We have provided a list of 10 government agencies that we recommend students attempt to redesign. If you feel the need to tweak that list by encouraging students to choose a local government website, do that. However, make sure it's a government website.

  - You'll be helping students to select a government agency website to redesign. There must be a minimum of two students per government agency website.

- Review the challenge assignment so that you can summarize it comfortably for students at the end of the lesson and field their questions.

> :pushpin: Your goal is to hold students accountable to consuming and understanding the challenge requirements. Remind students that if they have questions, to ask a friend, a TA, or the instructor. When students ask what is due, point students back to the challenge assignment documentation.

- Remind students to find a partner in their government agency, as part of the challenge in the next couple of weeks will require sharing and collaborating to grow their UI design skills.
- Spend time thinking about how the knowledge and skills you'll teach in this lesson create a foundation for UI and front-end development projects. This will help you stress the importance of internalizing the UI design process with students.

## Strategies for UI Class Online

- Class materials were not originally designed for online teaching, so gaps may exist in the instructional materials and the student experience. We know this an inconvenience and requires significant learning and preparation time on your part. We appreciate the effort you're putting in!

  - The curriculum team is busy updating Activities and creating new engagement strategies every day and adding it to the curriculum.
  - Look for this :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation** icon throughout the lesson, where we make specific suggestions for adapting the content for online teaching.

Online Teaching Strategies:

1. Pre-build and assign Zoom Breakout rooms to your TAs to streamline getting in and out of activities.

2. Shorten or combine review times to allow more time for the students on the activities.

3. During reviews, have everyone share their screen. As the instructor, you can then move among students at random, keeping everyone accountable and focused during reviews.

   - [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000424286-Sharing-Multiple-Screens-Simultaneously](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000424286-Sharing-Multiple-Screens-Simultaneously)

4. Assign an activity 'Student Lead' for each student breakout group.

   - This means that 1 student should create, share, and invite fellow activity members to their collaboration document, whether it be a Google Doc, Miro Board, InVision Freehand, Figma Artboard, etc. based on the activity needs.

5. Disable the Zoom Chat and communicate on Slack only.

   - [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207442843-Disable-Notifications-From-Group-Chat-Mobile-](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207442843-Disable-Notifications-From-Group-Chat-Mobile-)

6. Shorten Lecture times as much as possible to maximize activity interaction and production time.

7. Get creative with office hours.

   - Start scheduling 10 to 15 min office hour review blocks for you and the TAs to check in with each student to help maximize that time.
   - Use a Slack Poll to query your students for topic reviews, tool demos, etc.
     - [https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-)

- Teaching online is a challenge and we really, really appreciate your hard work. The curriculum team is very interested in how things go in your classrooms—both wins and failures. Please post in the 05-UX-UI-Course channel with anything you want to share.

- To help keep track of time during in-class student activities, use an online timer. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, which you can download here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/edebbhkhcaafmolanelponjjanocpacd?hl=en).

    <summary>Office Hours</summary>

## Office Hours: Review and Practice (45 min before class)

Encourage students to come early and use the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

</details>

## 1. Instructor Do: UI Unit Introduction and Today's Objectives (5 min)

> :pushpin: The goal of this section is to share your personal UI experiences with students and orient them with an overview of the UI portion of the boot camp.

Open and download today’s slides. TAs should share them with the students via Slack: [08-Week/01-Slides/08.1-UI Analysis and Design Fundamentals Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1swjj9baKtl4Y-vDcKp6TbhcThQGO9lZGL-UD4ILCN1E).

- This is the first day of the second pillar of the UX/UI Boot Camp. Give students the lay of the land for the UI design portion of the boot camp. For example:

  - Students will get closer to the user, as they will be focusing on the specific assets that actual users interact with.
  - Students will learn to design the look and feel of a UX, including grids, layouts, colors, and UI branding decisions.
  - Students will grow their visual design, UI design, information architecture, and interaction design skills by designing RWD prototypes and creating UIs that apply atomic design to their systems.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a couple of students to share the experience—no matter how minimal—they've already had with UI.

- We want students to know that what they learned in the UX portion of the boot camp will come to bear on this UI portion of the course. Share how UI builds on the UX skills they've learned. For example:

  - In UX, you learned and practiced the design thinking process and how to consider user needs first when solving a problem with a low-fidelity prototype. Now you'll add UI skills to your design thinking by creating high-fidelity prototypes.

  - The UI units amplify your UX thinking by diving deeper into the affordances of UIs and applying design system thinking to your high-fidelity solutions.

  - Along with implementing UI design skills, we will continue to grow our usability, accessibility, and user testing capabilities to make UI solutions that are valuable to all of our users.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share an anecdote from your early work that was an "aha" moment in UI.

Tell students how fun but challenging UI will be. The pace will continue to be quick. Remind students that boot camp is hard, with years of knowledge compressed into months, but it is a rewarding way to transition in life or advance their careers.

- UI design is challenging, but we'll help you gain these skills. Your growth will be astounding, but it will take work!

**Review today's objectives.**

- Share today's objectives.

- Talk about your current role and share your experience with designing UIs.

  - Quickly share a UI project you were involved in. Show a live project and slack out the link. If nothing live is available, share work from your portfolio.

  - Ask your TAs to share their UI projects as well.

## 2. Instructor Do: UI Designers (5 min)

> 📌 Let's start on the right foot and make sure all students get up to speed on some visual design basics. We will be covering graphic design quickly, so prepare students for an accelerated pace.

**TAs:** Post further reading links to Slack for students to review after class: 
- [T-Shaped People, https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437](https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437)

**Use the slides to introduce the basics of visual design.** 

> **Instructor Note:** Students will have a wide range of familiarity with visual design concepts. For those who know the material, this will serve as a refresher. For others, they'll want to practice these concepts at home to become proficient.

### UI Design Is Fun!

- Engage students by inviting participation as you take a quick, casual opinion poll (in-class):

  - Ask: "**Raise your hand if you have a background in visual communications.**" (For example, graphic design, architecture, product design, fine art, and so forth.)

- Students raise hands, and TAs can visually count the numbers of raised hands.

  - Quickly scan the room and note the range of skills. Remind students to help each other, share resources, and encourage one another.

  🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Use a Slack poll (https://www.polly.ai/slack-poll) or Zoom poll (https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings). To quickly engage your students.

  - Say: “The visual design world is massive and NO ONE is good at everything."
  
   - It will take more practice for some of you than for others. If you already think you "know" this material, keep in mind that there is always something new to learn and more practice will make you a seasoned professional.

  - Remind students that you also continue to learn and practice design.

**Read Jef Raskin's quote:** 

> "As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product."

- The late Jef Raskin was an American human–computer interface expert best known for conceiving and starting the Macintosh project at Apple in the late 1970s.

### UX Is Not UI–UI Is Part of UX

- While UX targets product optimization or making a service easy, effective, and pleasant for someone to use, UI focuses on the visual components, sensations, and interactivity.
- Remark on the conversations they'll hear in the UX/UI communities.

### Design Thinking is Applied to UI Design

*Review the slides on how design thinking is applied to UI design and the UI design process.* 

- Expore challenges
- Generate ideas
- Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver.
- UI is additive inside the design process. 

### UX vs. UI Job Descriptions

- UI designers work with UX designers and the design team. 
- Compare the UX versus the UI job descriptions.
- Remark that HR departments and job descriptions are always in flux.

:briefcase: **Employer Competitive Advantage:** Help students appreciate that the job landscape of UX/UI is always growing and organizations do not all value UX/UI equally. Being able to vet job roles by how well a potential employer describes and communicates about the open role is a good litmus test.

### UI Design Camps
**Review the two camps that gravitate toward UI design.**

- Graphic merely serves as a starting place.

  - Camp 1: Visual design

    - Graphic designers, artists, and craft makers are all visual communicators. The UI is about how an interface looks.

  - Camp 2: Code (front-end)

    - Human Computer Interaction (HCI)/software engineers are coders. UIs are code and need to be interacted with.

  - **But what if you don't fall into either of those camps?**

  - Don't fret! The UI is just as accessible to you as it is to anyone else. That is why you're here.

### T-Shaped Candidates

- Employers are looking for T-shaped candidates. 
- Ask, "Anyone ever heard of a T-shaped person?""

- Tell students that the TAs have posted in Slack a link to a Medium article about the T-shaped person for review *after class.* 

  - **TAs,** slack out for students to read at home: [https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437](https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437)

  - Remind students that the goal of this boot camp is to improve their T-shape as candidates.

## 3. Instructor Do: UI Design Review (5 min)

> 📌 Although this boot camp emphasizes on-screen interface design, the concepts are broader and relate to deeper thinking about solving problems for systems. UI design skills are deeply rooted in systems thinking and solving human-centered issues.

Use this section to verify and reinforce students' concept of interface.

- Review how an interface is a point between a system and an environment.

  - A point is where two systems—subjects and organizations—meet and interact.

  - For example, how the user and a computer system interact. In particular, the use of input devices and software.

### Quiz example: What Is a UI?

![Interface-Quiz.png](Images/Interface-Quiz.png)

- system = money, environment = bank

- Ask students: "**What is the interface?**"

  - Call on a few students and write their interface answers on the whiteboard.

  🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Have students add their answers to Slack. Quickly pull up the Slack channel and read off a few answers. 

  - Answer: interface = ATM, teller, banking app, facial recognition banking profile, and so forth.

> **Instructor Note:** Add your example on the whiteboard.

- If students are still struggling, draw a Venn diagram on the whiteboard and quiz them again (system/environment/interface).

  - Suggestions:
    - system = food
    - environment = restaurant
    - interface = menu, application, Yelp, etc.
  - or
    - system = travel
    - environment = city
    - interface = personal car, taxi, Uber, Lyft, scooter, bike, public transit, helicopter, etc.

### UI Types

- Touch User Interface (TUI)
  - Mobile, table, kiosk, watch, etc.

- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  - Every operating system (OS) and software.

- Voice User Interface (VUI)
  - Siri, Amazon Alexa, etc.

- Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR) Interface
  - Google Glass, Gaming, etc.

- Special-oriented sharing interface
  - Zoom, FaceTime, Google Docs, etc.

- We can hardly go a day without interfacing with a screen—a fact of life that demands designers continually improve UIs.

### UI Functional Layers

- Written language
  - Not all interfaces use Western European languages.
- Graphic design
  - Color, type, pattern, and hierarchy
- Sound
  - Beeps, boops, and feedback
- Motion
  - Moving image, change, and feedback
- Information design
  - Content and context
- Interface design
  - Controls, features, and buttons
- Interaction design
  - Task flow, behavior, and system feedback
- Programming
  - Front-end (HTML and CSS, etc.) and backend (MySQL, etc.) and logic

### UX Layers

- **TAs,** slack out the element of UX from Jesse James Garrett's link: [http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements_ch02.pdf](http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements_ch02.pdf)

:briefcase: **Employer Competitive Advantage:** As a UI designer, you will be evaluated for your ability to communicate the value of UI layers, hopefully presenting yourself as an expert. Employers want to see that you're worthy of building these layers for their users. Add these skills to your resume and case studies as you gain them.

## 4. Instructor Do: Review Student Project Example (5 min)

### Introduce Case Study 3

- Let students know that their case study project will become part of their UX/UI portfolios. This means that they should do their best work—work that they'll be proud to share with potential employers.

- **Review a student example:** Briefly demo the example of a student redesign: [https://www.behance.net/gallery/72470591/USDA-Style-Guide-Redesign](https://www.behance.net/gallery/72470591/USDA-Style-Guide-Redesign).

  - Scroll through this quickly and reference the opportunity to place work in Behance as a default portfolio.

## 5. Student Do: Choose a Government Agency Website to Redesign Activity (10 min)

Now that students have a general sense of what UI design is, let's jump into an activity that will help them with this week's challenge and the case study project.

> **Instructor Note:** Choosing their government agency is a big, exciting decision—whatever they choose will be their focus for the next five weeks!

- **TAs,** slack out the following:
  - In the United States, use this link: [08-Week/02-Activities/08.1/08.1-01-Government-Agency-Selection (in the USA)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BrlYc55vKe2UdkyQe_qVuk7QFjXHo6LcRTerZ1FGcPo/edit?usp=sharing)
  - In Canada, use this link: [08-Week/02-Activities/08.1/08.1.1-01-Government-Agency-Selection (in Canada)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fNRtHPFbSs10X0XcoYxM5d7IxPFKHN96d30gbPdaOBo/edit?usp=sharing)
  - In Australia, use this link: [08-Week/02-Activities/08.1/08.1.1-01-Government-Agency-Selection (in Australia)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEpzSL72fYImvhA0-ayKoVeKdkROUm6l9olt3nmfrU0/edit?usp=sharing)

**Summary**

In this activity, students will choose a government agency website to work with during the next five weeks. Students will work in groups to conduct user research for the project. That way, they can cover more ground and have peers review their UI design progress. It's important to be good partners who will encourage one another and hold one another accountable.

> :pushpin: The goal of this activity is to get students to choose a government agency to work with over the next five weeks.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Students might not yet know which agency they want to work on, so encourage them to start by thinking about concepts they're passionate about and map that interest to an agency. For example, if a student is interested in music, consider that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates radio stations that play music.

*For students who finish early*: Students who choose the same government agency should exchange contact information or create a government agency Slack channel to share their work and collaborate. Each agency must have a minimum of two students per agency.

**Instructions**

- Set a timer for 10 minutes.

- Write each agency on the whiteboard. Ask students to write their names under their chosen agency.

  - Each agency must have a minimum of two students to work on it.

  - If only one student chooses an agency, that student must recruit another student or make a new selection.

- Research teams with two members should self-organize (few of three in odd agency cases). If students need help, step in and pair them off into research teams.

  - Remind students that they must contribute equally and can share during the user research phase.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Select the appropriate template below. Share your screen, and as students join the document, have them add their names to an agency. Each agency should have a minimum of two students.
- For the United States, use this template: [08-Week/02-Activities/08.1/08.1-01.1-Government Agency Student Selection Template-USA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIZkAvy1t8YMtC8SErvWC_uBSV_5fF29a5UxIeriP4M/edit?usp=sharing) 
- For Canada, use this template: [08-Week/02-Activities/08.1/08.1-02.1-Government Agency Student Selection Template-Canada](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o48Ade85mTRFPcr7COf01O0b8MWgL_Usfv_a5GMEaqg/edit?usp=sharing)

**Deliverable**

Students share their government agency selection and the reasons users would visit the site.

> **Instructor Note:** To be sure students have chosen an agency and that each agency has at least two students assigned to it, gather everyone to review their choices as a group.

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor the students. Do they need help selecting their government agency? Are they stuck? Remind students that any site they choose will offer a unique design challenge for them to sink their teeth into.

## 6. Instructor Do: Choose a Government Website to Redesign Activity Review (5 min)

🌐**Online class:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen. Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

During the review, students will gather in pairs. Remind them that we'll all work together on these UI skills and create solutions that will become excellent portfolio case studies.

- Ask a few teams to share why they chose their agencies.

  - "Are you familiar with your agency's mission?"

- Remind students that, just like in their careers, although they will not always love their clients, they will solve their UI problems anyway.

Discuss common misconceptions or FAQs about working with government agencies or what they do. This will help to prevent students from second-guessing their choice. For example:

- Government agency websites are highly informational, designed for as many users as possible and typically have design issues that will keep students busy and also able to display their value in a redesign.

- Aligning human-centered thinking to democratic institutions is worthy of students' time. Applying design thinking and UI design to redesign government websites will yield valuable portfolio case studies.

At this point, students have learned the essentials of UI design and about their government agency project. Open their eyes to universal design—accessibility for all. This will add the most crucial ingredient to understanding UI design—people.

## 7. Instructor Do: UI Analysis and Universal Design (15 min)

> :pushpin: Now that students have chosen a project, they can start making progress over the next five weeks. We start UI from a research standpoint, digging into the analysis and diagnosis of what is not working and why. This lecture supports the first of today's learning objectives, which is for students to analyze a UI by using the 10 usability heuristics and articulate usability issues that exist in UX.

### Questionable Design

You'll begin by looking at examples of "terrible" design on the internet, then discuss the Universal Design Principles.

- Remind students that the internet is filled with terrible design.
- View the Yale School of Art's webpage.
  - **TAs,** slack out the following: [http://art.yale.edu/](http://art.yale.edu/).
- **Note:** TAs will share several links via Slack during this lecture. Let students know resources should be reviewed at home.

- You don't have to go very far to find websites, apps, or software that look dreadful. Luckily, in this class, you'll learn how to create better designs to improve the UX with interfaces.

**Share Massimo Vignelli's quote:** "The life of a designer is a life of fight. Fight against the ugliness."
- The late Massimo Vignelli was a famous graphic designer, known for creating the New York City subway map as well as an array of stunning public signs. He loved Helvetica.

### UI Analysis
- How do we determine what works and what doesn't?

  - It starts with UI analysis: user perspective (user research), business perspective (competitive analysis), expert perspective (UX/UI designers), and technical perspective (front-end developers).

- After taking this boot camp, whenever you present yourself as a UX/UI designer, people will call on your expertise.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Tell the class about a redesign that helped a client's site go from sad to beautiful. Alternatively, ask a TA to share.

- We become experts by gaining experience over time and by caring about aspects of a system most others don't care about (i.e., people and usability).

**Share Steve Krug's quote:** "Usability is about people and how they understand and use things, not about technology."
- UX designer-author Steve Krug is an expert in human-computer interaction and usability. 
- Ask, "How many of you have read Krug's book *Don't Make Me Think* on web usability?"
- **TAs,** slack out: [https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)

### Universal Design

Universal design aims to create buildings, products, services, software, and environments that are accessible to everyone—seniors as well as people with or without disabilities. The Principles of Universal Design are an invaluable resource you can use to plan and guide your design process intelligently.

- **TAs,** slack out the link:
  [http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/](http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/)

“Twenty percent of people in the United States and 15 percent globally have a disability.” We shouldn't ignore people with disabilities; they represent almost 20 percent of all online consumers.

**TAs,** slack out these links:
- [https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html)
- [https://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/](https://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/)

### Universal Design Principles

**Share Ron's Mace's quote:** 

> "Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people."

- The late Ron Mace was an architect and considered the "father of universal design."

Universal design principles are guidelines of inclusive design for the masses.

- The UN's Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) protects the rights and dignity of disabled people. The treaty calls for the removal of environmental and attitudinal barriers in physical and digital spaces.

- **TAs,** slack out the link: [http://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/CRPD](http://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/CRPD)

### The Seven Principles of Universal Design

- **Principle 1: Equitable Use —** Equitable use is the first principle because it is the driver for accessibility. The principle promotes you to think about users with different abilities. When you use this principle, you must consider all users instead of only the target users.

  - *Example*: Use a strong color contrast to avoid stigmatizing users with color blindness. You can avoid segregating or stigmatizing your users by designing color palettes with strong contrast.

- **Principle 2: Flexibility in Use —** No one person is the same as another. A static and inflexible design could never accommodate all users. The Flexibility in Use principle encourages flexible, adaptable, and customizable design.

  - *Example*: Provide customization for dashboards like Trello. Customization is a technique to accommodate a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. It enables users to choose and organize what they see on a website and how they will use it. Dashboards are good examples of customization.

- **Principle 3: Simple and Easy to Use —** Simple and intuitive use is one of the goals of UX design. It’s not surprising that this is also one of the Universal Design Principles. This principle aims to reduce complexity and mental or cognitive loads. According to the cognitive load theory, humans can handle only three to nine items in a short amount of time when processing information.

  - *Example*: Progressive Disclosure is an interaction design technique that reduces visual clutter and removes irrelevant information on the screen. It prioritizes information to display on the screen based on user needs and interactions. On top of that, it allows the user to drill down for more information, usually without a page load. We see this with iOS settings, as we navigate the flow for setting up Wi-Fi on the iPhone.

- **Principle 4: Perceptible Information —** Information is critical to users. Whether it’s communicated via text, pictures, audios, or videos, make sure the information is easy to digest and access.

  - *Example*: Enable users with hearing impairments to watch videos with video transcription. Multimedia requires multisensory experiences, especially videos. People with hearing problems or language barriers have difficulty consuming information from videos. You can remove these barriers by providing video transcriptions and subtitles. Video transcriptions and subtitles add an alternative channel. They allow users to consume words and information from the video without relying on hearing. Designing with accessibility in mind can be a win-win situation for both the company and the users–just as it is for TED.

- **Principle 5: Tolerance for Error —** Errors are inevitable among humans; hence, the adage “to err is human.” We should design for an error-friendly environment. Universal design aims to design for all users. It also aims to design in anticipation of different environments and users’ actions. This principle pushes you to think beyond the screen and how the system and user will interact with each other.

  - *Example*: Twitter reduces submission errors with form validation. There are three ways to validate form inputs.

- **Principle 6: Low Physical Effort —** We might not associate physical effort with using the web. Most people can comfortably sit down and use a mouse. However, working at a computer can be taxing on our bodies because many people use their computers for eight or more consecutive hours. People with physical disabilities have even more difficulty with using the web for extended periods. For example, those with mobility issues might have a hard time moving the mouse to the desired target. This is why designing for low physical effort is vital.

  - *Example*: Minimize mouse use with keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard shortcuts reduce the need to move from the keyboard to the mouse for simple tasks. For example, here are the shortcuts for the UI vector application Sketch: https://www.sketchappsources.com/shortcuts.html.

- **Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use —** For product designers, their focus is on form factors such as the size and space involved with the product. As digital designers, our focus is less on form factors than on what is on the screen. This is a shortsighted mindset because it is essential to think outside of the screen and consider our users’ environment as well, especially because users view websites not only on desktops but increasingly on mobile devices.
- *Example*: On a desktop, a user interacts with a website via a small pointer on the screen. On a mobile device, a user interacts with a website using his or her index finger or thumb. A small target area can be a problem on mobile devices because it is more difficult to select with precision.

### Usability Heuristics

Usability heuristics attempt to address Universal Design Principles on the web.

It's time to make sure all students get up to speed on UI usability heuristics. We mentioned this during UX, but during UI is where the rubber hits the road. These concepts will take a minute to sink in with your students, so remind them to practice at home and that we will be reviewing and critiquing with these aspects in mind.

**Review why and when of usability heuristics.**

- Usability is a feedback loop as well as a highly valuable skill set.
- **WHAT Usability Hueristics are:** Jakob Nielsen’s 10 general principles for interaction design. They are called “heuristics” because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines. 
- **WHEN to use Usability Heuristics:**  
  - As UX/UI designers, we want to build usable solutions. We are not the users; therefore, we validate usability through testing.
    - Testing designs to validate an iteration.
    - Evaluating a new feature.
    - Understand who is the user.
- **WHY use Usability Heuristics?**
  - Usability is a feedback process allowing UX/UI to design better and faster. If you are not validating along the way, you will make significant mistakes.
    - To create designs that are truly usable for your users.
    - To create designs that are easy and pleasurable to use.
    - To communicate how and why a software solution is or is not usable.
- Universal Design Principles can be analyzed and diagnosed through usability heuristics.

  - Developed by Jakob Nielsen of the Nielsen Norman Group.

### 10 Usability Heuristics

Read off (on 10 fingers):
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between the system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Helps user recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

- UX/UI designers are expected to be the usability nerds.

  - This means memorizing the usability heuristics and analyzing experiences against these factors.

:briefcase: **Employer Competitive Advantage:** Adding Universal Design Principles to your case studies and resume, as well as being able to speak to how your solutions are universal and human-centered, will go a long way during an interview.

- Let's get some hands-on practice with heuristics in the next activity.

## 8. Student Do: Group Heuristic Evaluation Activity (25 min)

It's time to explore more about UI usability. The goal is to get students to quickly identify and analyze their government agency homepage using the 10 usability heuristics.

**TAs,** slack out to students the following files:
-  Heuristic Analysis Google Doc: [08-Week/02-Activities/08.1/08.1-02-UI-Heuristic-Analysis-Google-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19OuCll0ijX4KLCCqoKsN8ypMrCqMaFVfDoDc4u6DwL8)

- Heuristic Evaluation Checklist Google Sheet: [08-Week/02-Activities/08.1/08.1-02-UI-Heuristic-Evaluation-Checklist-Google-Sheet-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XfMzdFsH0Y23sAvy47urNvKhsvlovuUfKdBQXOhw6LU)

- [08.1-02-Design-Heuristics-Annotation-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/kyEpqS9ebm2TUQqzPyfy18/08.1-02-Design-Heuristics-Annotation-Template)

- Set a timer for 25 minutes.

**Instructor and TAs:** Watch out for groups that get stalled. If they get stuck in one part of the checklist, suggest they skip forward to another part of the checklist.

**Summary**

This activity will give students a chance to see how their government website stacks up against UX best practices—specifically heuristic design principles.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Have students start by focusing on four heuristics first: No. 1. visibility, No. 2. match, No. 4. consistency, and No. 8. minimalism.

Those four are typically more visual and easier to identify first. Next, have them move to other heuristics that require more interaction to make an evaluation.

*For students who finish early*: Heuristic evaluations are extended into their weekly challenge, so these students should continue to work on other pages, which will apply to their assignment requirements.

**Instructions**

Students will start by getting into groups of two to three with students who are redesigning the same government site. Then they will download the Heuristic Evaluation Checklist. From there, they will follow the checklist and analyze the site while making notes about what they find.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Get students who are working on the same government agency into their own Zoom breakout rooms. TAs can reference the agency selection template to establish these student groupings. Stick to a minimum of two students and a max of six. Assign TAs to the breakout rooms in order to support students and field questions. **Tip:** If students need more time for the activity, you can shorten the review time.

**Deliverable**

Students will share a completed heuristic evaluation for their government website via Slack.

## 9. Instructor Do: Group Heuristic Evaluation Activity Review (15 min)

Call attention back and briefly discuss how the activity went for students, including their frustrations and observations.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen. Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Next, **choose two to three groups' work** and review their heuristic analysis samples.

- **Ask**: "Does any team want to share their usability analysis?"

  - "What was the easiest usability issue to find?"
  - "What were some big issues you found?"
  - "Was there anything that was just terrible?"

- **Have a short conversation**. You don't have to be a UX/UI designer to recognize terrible usability! It gets harder over time, and as a UX/UI designer your role is to look deeper.
- User testing will improve your ability to catch and improve usability.
- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they try this skill, for example:

  - Usability is deeply researched, so be on the lookout for other UX/UI design examples of heuristic evaluation or UI take downs, or critiques, to help you hone your own experiences.

  - Evaluating usability requires practice and thinking deeply about why a UX/UI and dev team made a design decision. So think about applications you use the most and what enables you to use them repeatedly (their usability).

- **Ask**: "Now that you have an analysis, what do you do now?"

- **Have a short conversation about delivering hard news**, even that a website is awful. Your client doesn't want to hear you say, "it's terrible" so bluntly. Convey that your opinion represents the user, based on your expertise as a UX/UI designer.

> **Instructor Note:** Share a personal story of addressing a usability issue.

Finally, discuss any common misconceptions and FAQs about usability heuristics. For example:

- "A perfect score on a heuristic evaluation = a successful product in the market." *False!* Usability is one of many factors that determine a product's success. Improving usability will improve, but not guarantee, market success.
- "Heuristic evaluation should only be done by an outside UX/UI design consultant rather than by the team that designed the solution." *False!*  Although getting a fresh perspective on a UI can be helpful, and is a service many UX/UI freelancers or UX/UI consultancies offer, internal teams are just as capable of building and evaluating their work for usability.

## 10. Break (15 min)

Take a break. Breaks are part of learning, giving students' brains the opportunity to digest the learning.

- If running late, shorten the break.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Don't stop sharing your screen during the break. Instead, display a Google timer or YouTube timer video on your screen. That will help get students back into the Zoom room on time.

## 11. Instructor Do: Usability and Accessibility (10 min)

> 📌 The goal is to get students to understand how to practice universal design decisions through testing for usability and accessibility. This lecture supports the second learning objective, which is for students to test a UI color palette that represents primary, secondary, and tertiary interaction hierarchy against color accessibility ratio guidelines and iterate the UI color palettes based on feedback.

**Say:**  "If you're thinking, 'Wow, UI usability is awesome,' that's a great sign. 

Why? Because if you're engaged, you will be able to create interactions that make users happy.

- As we discussed, creating a great UX starts with caring about your user—and that means all users.

> **TAs:** slack out to students the WC3 WAI video:

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20SHvU2PKsM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20SHvU2PKsM)

- Discuss why we should care about this. For example:

  - Designing for all users is the goal. Making systems usable is the minimum requirement for UX; usability by itself doesn't equal great UX.

**TAs,** slack out: [https://uxdesign.cc/accessibility-guidelines-for-a-ux-designer-c3ba775539be](https://uxdesign.cc/accessibility-guidelines-for-a-ux-designer-c3ba775539be)

### Accessibility Considerations

- Hearing difficulty:

  - Hearing impaired users span those who have difficulty with audio frequency ranges to those who are deaf.

- Visual difficulty:

  - Visually impaired users range from those with color blindness to those who are entirely blind.

- Cognitive and neurological difficulty:

  - Memory and intellectual impairment might affect a variety of users, including those with failing memory, those with concentration issues, and those with perception issues.

- Physical difficulty:

  - Physical impairment affects users who may have difficulty with mobility, muscle control, or dynamic interactions.

>:gem: **Student Insight:** Ask one or two students to share their insights or knowledge about accessibility. They may have friends or family who hear or see differently, which are forms of user insight.

### Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

**Review the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).**

- Especially when coding the final scalable website, we need to consider the standards for making content for all users.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Tell the class about accessibility design in your own work.

 **TAs,** slack out:

- WCAG 2.1 — Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ver. 2.1:

  - [https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php)

- WAI-ARIA — Accessible Rich Internet Applications:

  - [https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php)

- ATAG — Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines:

  - [https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)

- Remind students that accessibility is the center of caring for your users. You're expected to build solutions that apply these standards.

**Review Section 508 Compliance.**

- **Ask**, "Any questions?"

  - Have a short discussion. If there are many questions, tell students to write them down and ask in Slack, and you can help answer during office hours.

### Accessibility and User Research

Listen, observe, discuss, probe. Observe how all the things you do as a user researcher work. Participate in card sorting. It isn’t easy. For example, using an online card sorting tool might exclude people with disabilities. If you're doing a brainstorm session in a room, how can people in wheelchairs and scooters participate?

### Accessibility and Content Strategy

Three main questions you need to ask as a content strategist:

- Does the content create clear expectations at all levels? That means page titles, links, form labels, and guiding instructional text.

- Is there any specific content that people with disabilities need?

- Are there any specific needs for customer service or communication for people with disabilities?

### Example: Accessibility and Content Strategy

Imagine users are using a banking website to pay their bills, but they are confused because they don’t know which step they are on. This is a preventable problem. We have the opportunity to use content strategy to orient the users, define the interaction state, and provide the right feedback in an interaction. Think about the online banking example. Before, there were no defined page titles, but now users know what step they are on because of defined page titles.

### Accessibility and Interaction Design

No two people do things the same. We often design like there is only one path to complete a task. That might be true. A user tries to complete a task because it often contributes to a higher goal. Interaction designers are responsible for creating task flows and use cases, but you're always responsible for thinking about that task in the user’s mind. For example, if we design with a higher purpose in mind, we might design something different. As part of our process, we need to think about multiple methods for people to accomplish that goal. How might people with different disabilities interact with podcast content to learn to make sushi?

- You must consider how people with different disabilities might want to accomplish a goal or complete a task. Build this thinking into your design process.

### Accessible Visual Design

As a designer, you can influence the accessibility of a product through visual design choices. Color plays a big part, as it communicates status and helps us distinguish one thing from another.

- Almost 315 million people in the world are color blind.

- **Ask,** "Is anyone here color blind?"

For example, say you have a graph. How does it look to someone with normal vision versus someone who is color blind? How would you show a difference between lines? You would use patterns or shapes. Do not rely on color alone.

- TIP: Do not rely on color alone. Use shape and color, or use pattern and color.

### Example: Accessibility and Visual Design

Let's look at the following e-commerce layout. If you were color blind, how could one make this web layout more accessible?

- Someone who is color blind would only see the colors in the same shade.

- *ANSWER:* We could add color labels so that color blind users will have an idea of which color they would like to choose.

- Remind students that accessibility should not be a checklist but rather criteria for good design.

- Let's get into considering the total package of users and test our accessibility.

### Tool Snapshot: Accessibility Testing

- **WHAT accessibility testing is:** 

  Accessibility testing is a type of software testing performed to ensure that the application being tested is usable by people with disabilities such as hearing loss, color blindness, old age, and other disadvantaged groups. It is a subset of usability testing.  

- **WHEN to use accessibility testing:** 

  As UX/UI designers, we want to build solutions for every user. Considering all users throughout the process will create more usable and accessible products.

  - Testing designs to validate if they are useable by all users.
  - Evaluating a new feature.
  - Implementing scalable software solutions.

- **WHY use accessibility testing:**
  - To create designs that are truly usable for all of your users.
  - To create designs that are as accessible as possible.
  - To communicate how and why a software solution is designed for the widest range of users possible. 

> Any questions? 

:briefcase: **Employer Competitive Advantage:** As a UI designer, you will be required to build accessible solutions. Your ability to show this level of detail in your work and case study projects will show employers that you are taking it seriously.

## 12. Student Do: Color Accessibility Assessment Activity (15 min)

It's time to dive deeper into our designing for every user. Gaining proficiency in building accessible webpages starts with caring about accessibility and usability together. Remind students this is about testing your considerations throughout the process.

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity file:
[08-Week/02-Activities/08.1/08.1-03-UI-Color-Accessibility-Activity](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xqpK0Jz0FNraaE2nt0mUg4dARSpXxyNqCeO5N43y_MM)

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor and help students who need assistance. 

**Summary**

Students will practice creating color palettes from a site analyzer online and using an accessibility analyzer online. These tools will help them to see how well their palette addresses color blindness and other accessibility needs. There is a bonus step, too: Practice executing a screen reader test on a mobile application.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Colors offer billions of options, so have students choose one that they think should be an interaction color. For example, a color for their button, and from there, they can do their type color.

*For students who finish early*: Have them move into other colors for their UI palette.

**Instructions**

Working alone, students extract a color palette using an online tool, then run an analysis of each color (Hex code) and make notes about their findings. Then, in small groups working on the same government site, they will discuss their findings.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Get students working on the same government agency into Zoom breakout rooms. TAs can refer to the agency selection template to establish these student groupings. Use a minimum of two students and a max of six. Assign TAs to visit breakout rooms to offer assistance to students. **Tip:** If students need more time for the activity, reduce the review time.

**Deliverable**

Students will post notes to Slack that show their analysis of the accessibility analysis.

## 13. Instructor Do: Color Accessibility Assessment Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen. Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Call on a few students to share and **ask**:
  - "What did you learn about your team's color accessibility?"
  - "Have you ever considered how everyone sees the colors you wear?"
- Quickly discuss that gathering samples and using those samples is a big part of weekly challenge and UI practice.
- Now give students some actionable feedback they can apply the next time they're analyzing accessibility. For example:

  - Color is just one accessibility factor, but it can be most readily addressed and should be shared by all team members. Make sure your team is aware that 8% of the population is color blind.

  - Use accessibility color ratings in conversations with your clients, who will typically have opinions on color. The goal is to get your clients to make accessible decisions as well, but they should be pushed by the designer.

Discuss any common misconceptions and FAQs about performing accessibility analysis. For example:
- "Accessibility ratings work against visual design, making everything uglier." *False!* Designers must avoid getting lazy or caring more about aesthetics than their users.
- "Accessibility should be considered last." *False!* Retrofitting a website, software, or application is harder and more time-consuming. Instead, designers must build usable and accessible solutions from the start, period.

## 14. Instructor Do: UI Best Practices (10 min)

> :pushpin: Your goal here is to make best practices for UI design meaningful for students. This lecture supports today's third learning objective, which is for students to define how usability testing leads to UI patterns and recall 10 usability best practices for the web.

Call the class back to attention. It's time to walk students through UI best practices and UI patterns, which will serve them now and throughout their careers.

> **Instructor Note:** We hope students will dive in deeper at home and practice these design concepts. Review quickly and remind students that there are many resources they can use to get up to speed.

### UIs

Review the types of interfaces common today and the potential standard interfaces of the future.

- We know what UI is and isn’t, but how do we design and implement UI effectively? There are some key ideas that one should bear in mind when designing for interfaces—best practices. These UI best practices are closely related to more general design principles in terms of hierarchy, contrast, and layout. These practices are taken from Usability.gov. They focus on predicting what users might need to do and ensuring that the designed interface has functionality that is easy to understand and use.

- Improving usability starts with UI best practices.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Help students connect the "theory" to the real world by telling them how you design with UI best practices in mind for your clients.

### UI Best Practices

- Review when and why to use UI best practices and UI patterns.

  - When to use it?
    - UI is learned and built on over time. Use standard best practices and UI patterns when exploring solutions.

  - Why use it?
    - Users learn interfaces through patterns. We don’t want to retrain our users regularly; therefore, we use existing UI elements to enhance usability.
- **Keep it simple and create consistency by using common UI elements.** Avoid unnecessary elements and make sure labels and messaging are clear. Common elements help users accomplish tasks quickly. Establish patterns in language, layout, and design to facilitate efficiency. 
- **Be purposeful in your page layout.** Consider the spatial relationships between items on the page, and structure the page based on importance. Careful placement of items can help draw attention to the essential pieces of information and can aid scanning and readability.
- **Strategically use color and texture.** Strategically use color and texture. You can direct attention toward or redirect attention away from items using color, light, contrast, and texture.
- **Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity.** Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity. Carefully consider how you use the typeface. Use different sizes, fonts, and arrangement of the text to help increase scanability, legibility, and readability.
- **Make sure that the system communicates what’s happening.** Always inform your users of locations, actions, changes in state, or errors. The use of various UI elements to communicate status and, if necessary, next steps can reduce frustration for your user.
- **Think about the defaults.** By carefully thinking about and anticipating the goals people bring to your site, you can create defaults that reduce the burden on the user. This becomes particularly important when it comes to form design where you might have an opportunity to have some fields pre-chosen or filled out.
- Interfaces are based off the real world.

  - Buttons, shelves, knobs, levers, controls, etc.
- Everything in an interface is learned.
- UI uses patterns to build on previous experience.
- UI pattern resources:

  - **TAs,** add to Slack:
      - [http://ui-patterns.com/](http://ui-patterns.com/)
      - [http://uipatterns.io/](http://uipatterns.io/)
      - Share others you know of as well.
      - *Note:* Tell students to check out these links at home.
- Reviewing these design tips is a lot in a short time, but students will have a chance to work with UI types for the rest of their boot camp and their UX/UI careers. Continue to internalize these ideas and be able to find uses for them in the real world.

### Review UI Annotations

**WHAT is a UX/UI documentation Annotation?**

An annotation is extra information associated with a particular point in a document or other piece of information. It can be a note that includes a comment or explanation. Annotations are sometimes presented in the margins of documents or a digital layers. 

**WHEN does a design use a UX/UI documentation Annotation?**

- Used during evaluation and analysis of products and services.

- Included as part of design documentation.

- Added as communication layers and technical documentation.

**WHY are UX/UI documentation Annotations used?**

- To create detailed documentation.

- To improve the handoff and collaboration with team members.

- To communicate how, why, and other technical details that are associated with a software solution.

:briefcase: **Employer Competitive Advantage:** As a UI designer, your ability to execute UI best practices and UI patterns is essential. Be sure to add "an expert in UI patterns" to your resume.

**Say:** Documentation is essential in your UX/UI practice.

Now that students have gained some analysis skills in their UI (heuristics and accessibility to UI patterns), it's time to road test what they've learned. A hands-on annotation challenge is next!

## 15. Student Do: UI Pattern Analysis and UI Pattern Annotation Challenge (20 min)

- **TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity file:
  [08-Week/02-Activities/08.1/08.1-04-UI-Pattern-Analysis-Activity-Google-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WITlUXrFaj1Q24ygk0QbaCRq-4czTKVZJdnLBzsJAIk)

**Instructor and TAs:** Give students support by walking the room and offering help to students who seem to be stuck or have questions.

Students learned about UI annotation during Units 1-5. Now they will be applying it in a UI context.

**Summary**

This activity provides practice with annotation, which is about visualizing and contextualizing feedback, much like a critique.

Students will analyze a page of their government site for UI design patterns.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Review the webpage from top to bottom, adding markup to UI objects as you encounter them.

*For students who finish early*: Unlikely, but these students should move on to another webpage to annotate as it will help them make progress on their challenge.

**Instructions**

In teams of two to three, students will take a screenshot of a page of their choosing from their government website to analyze which UI design patterns are being used. They will then decide which issues are a high priority on the basis of usability needs. Next, they will annotate a webpage to further analyze UI design patterns for the webpage. Finally, they will create an artboard in Figma/Adobe XD in which they’ll create recommendations for improving the webpage.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Get students who are working on the same government agency into Zoom breakout rooms and have them work together using Figma.

**Deliverable**

Student groups will submit an Adobe XD artboard or Figma link containing recommendations for webpage improvements.

If some students don't finish the activity, or any students have questions, invite them to stay after class for office hours.

## 16. Instructor Do: UI Pattern Analysis and UI Pattern Annotating Challenge Review (5 min) 

Call the class back to attention.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen. Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Call on a few students to share and **ask**:
  - Which webpage of your government agency website did you choose? Why?
  - Which UI design patterns did you encounter?
  - What issues did you decide to focus on for your redesign? Why?

## 17. Instructor Do: Recap, Challenge, and UI Design Showcase and End Class (5 min)

We did it! You did it!

### Review Concepts

Spend a couple of minutes helping students anchor today’s learning. Ask students to raise their hands—or post answers in Slack—and offer definitions for the following concepts, all learned today in class:

- What is the value of UI design? (Answer: It increases user satisfaction.)
- What are some usability heuristics? (Answer: pleasing color scheme, easy to scan, help on every page, etc.)
- What makes a site accessible? (Answer: color palette, grayscale, high contrast, clearly defined buttons/fields, etc.)
- What are some UI best practices? (Answer: simplicity, color and texture, typography to create hierarchy, etc.)

### Introduce Assignment 8

Open the challenge instructions and review them with students.

- Imagine you're a UI designer and you have to redesign a government agency website because it is not easily usable or accessible. Seems like an overwhelming task, right? I can imagine you saying, "There's so much information! How do I know what to build? Where do I start?"

- This week you'll serve as a user researcher performing varied tasks: **heuristic evaluation, accessibility testing, usability testing, annotating, card sorting, and building a sitemap**.
- The challenge will span the next five weeks.
- **Why this assignment?** So you can learn the UI design process, best practices, and responsive design.

- Tell students that in the next class, we'll continue growing our design foundations.

  - Everyone should be adding to the UI moodboards that they started in class today!

#### UI Design Showcase Walkthrough

Help students grasp the goals of this challenge and their new design challenge with a look at what previous students have accomplished.

Use the links in your slide deck to show students the following:

- The high-fidelity prototyping example
- The National Park Service Agency student redesign case study 
- The Nonprofit Group Project 2 student case study for Ziker Botanical Gardens

Take questions and invite students to stay after class to discuss further.

#### End Class

- Remind students about after-class office hours.

- Wish everyone a good night.
