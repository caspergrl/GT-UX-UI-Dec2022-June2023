# 8.2 Lesson Plan: Design Principles and Color Theory

## Overview

Today's class will introduce students to visual design and graphic design principles, further building their UI design skills. This lesson will familiarize them with Gestalt laws, elements of design, and color theory.

Lesson 8.1 introduced UI analysis and design. Today, Lesson 8.2 will cover visual design and graphic design principles to teach students to recognize good design and identify which elements of design are in play. The next class, Lesson 8.3, will round out this unit by covering typography, type styles, UI grids, and building grids in Figma/Adobe XD. All together, Unit 8 enables students to gain vital skills in visual design thinking to tell human-centered stories that move clients to build more useful, usable, and delightful user experiences.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Construct an InVision moodboard with five to 10 UI samples for each of the Gestalt laws.
2. Collect and organize design principle samples into InVision Boards.
3. Capture and identify a personal color palette from a photograph using Adobe Color.
4. Select and design a UI color palette for a brand that represents primary, secondary, and tertiary interaction hierarchies.

## Class at a Glance

- Welcome to Lesson 8.2 on design principles and color theory. We'll build on the students' abilities to infuse human-centered design into solving UI issues by considering visual design communications.

- Today's class is about visual design fundamentals. The lesson has three parts:

  - Part 1 introduces students to visual thinking via Gestalt laws.
  - Part 2 covers elements of design and InVision moodboards.
  - Part 3 provides students with practice with color theory and building color palettes.

- By the end of today's class, students should understand design principles and color theory and how they relate to UI design decisions.


## Instructor Notes

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine the activities and reviews by doing some activities as a class instead of creating breakout groups.

## Preparing for Class

- Review the slides for the lecture: [08-Week/01-Slides/08.2-Design Principles and Color Theory Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fJ14XWm52Ct3SGDT8iVxQoGEcixKwQA4BIyTR99BRXU).

- Read through this entire lesson plan, slides, student activity files, as well as the Time Tracker. 
  - Make notes so that you are thoroughly prepared to teach and support students.
  - Prepare professional anecdotes to bring a taste of the real world into class. Look for the :gem: **Designer Insight** icon throughout this lesson plan, which offers an opportunity to share an anecdote from your professional experience. 

- You'll give two demos today, so be sure to practice them in advance:
  - Demo of InVision boards (Section 5).
  - Demo of Adobe CC (Section 19).
- Prepare to be engaged with your students' progress today by:
    - Working with your teaching assistants (TAs) to help students.
    - Paying close attention to students' individual needs.
  - Encouraging their use of office hours to gain more feedback.
  - Sharing UI resources and encouraging students to practice often.



## Student Materials

- Recommend that students bookmark and regularly visit Daily UI to improve their UI production skills and speed.

  - **TAs,** slack out [https://www.dailyui.co/](https://www.dailyui.co/).

- We'll use Adobe XD to demo and build activities.

  - **TAs,** slack out [Adobe XD tutorials](https://helpx.adobe.com/xd/tutorials.html).

## Office Hours: Review and Practice (45 min before class)

Encourage students to come early and use the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> - Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Introduce Design Principles and Today's Objectives (5 min)

Today's learning journey is a visual one that concerns the power of color and how the human eye sees objects and composition.

- Open up the slides for the lecture: [08-Week/01-Slides/08.2-Design Principles and Color Theory Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fJ14XWm52Ct3SGDT8iVxQoGEcixKwQA4BIyTR99BRXU).
  - **TAs:** Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.

- Welcome students and let them know you're going to give them an entire semester's worth of knowledge about visual design today!

> :gem: **Design Insight:** Quickly share your experience using color to affect UI design.
>
> - Alternatively, invite a TA to share.

**Share today's objectives.**

- Connect today's learning to concepts, ideas, and abilities students gained during the UX portion of the boot camp. For example:
  - Design thinking is a problem-solving framework. However, if your solutions are not communicated clearly or don't look and feel like the brands they represent, it diminishes the value a human-centered solution creates.
  - The truth is that our users judge the appearance of our products. Designers need to use Gestalt laws, visual design principles, and design elements to improve the user/product relationship.
  - UX is all about focusing on users' needs first. If your UI doesn't embody those ideas very well, it can lead to usability issues, style over substance, and user confusion.

- Use metaphors to engage your students' imagination to get the most out of today's lesson. For example:
  - Color is to design what sound effects are to horror movies: it creates a look and feel, communicates emotion, and adds depth and dimension. A creaky door in a horror movie is like a blinking red button on a homepage—it scares you a bit!
    - Yet color and sound effects both follow rules and just as there are "bad" ways to do color in design, there are "bad" ways to do sound in movies—i.e., both follow best practices.

> **Instructor Note:** UI design is challenging, but we're here to help you gain these skills. Your growth will be astounding, but it will take some work.

- Prepare your students for an accelerated pace. If they are brand new to design, encourage them to work extra hard at practicing these skills outside of class. Design is a learn-by-doing skill, and there is no substitute for *doing* the work.

Now that students know what the day holds, let them know you'll start your visual journey with a dive into Gestalt laws that guide designers.

## 2. Instructor Do: Gestalt Laws (15 min)

> 📌 In design school, instructors have an entire year to expound on visual design principles. During boot camp, we maximize our limited time. Your goal in this lecture is to swiftly cover Gestalt laws and prepare your students for the accelerated pace.

Forget the speed limit—it's time to drive fast. You'll quickly but effectively teach the foundations of UI design, specifically Gestalt laws. Tell students: "You'll be absorbing a lot—we pack a semester of graphic design knowledge into an hour, so strive to keep up. We'll share resources as well."

**Review terms associated with Gestalt laws.**

- "Gestalt" is German for shape or form.
  - "Gestalt theory" says that the whole of anything is greater than its parts. Examples are:
    - Water—one molecule of water doesn't flow. Many molecules together form a whole that is greater than a single part/molecule.
    - A novel—letters of the alphabet or words are meaningless but as a whole story (or even a sentence) create meaning.
- Gestalt laws play an important role in UI. Why? Because they are laws of perception—how we see things and how we interpret what we see—and we care about how our users see/perceive what we build. 
  - Back in the 20th Century, researchers discovered that our brains perceive the environment through laws of similarity, closure, symmetry, etc. *rather* than through the play of light (light and shadows). This is why we see a "circle" even if it's not a fully closed circle—our brain closes the circle.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Relate how Gestalt laws figure into your own work.
>
> - Alternatively, invite a TA to share.

**Say:** "I need a few volunteers to read the eight Gestalt laws aloud."

1. Proximity
2. Similarity
3. Closure
4. Enclosure/Common Regions
5. Continuation
6. Common Fate
7. Symmetry and Order
8. Figure-Ground

"Gestalt laws" are rules of how we perceive the world.

Now review each of the eight Gestalt laws, one by one. 

**Ask:**  How does each visual sample fulfill a Gestalt law?" Call on students to answer.

- **1.** Proximity: Sun Microsystems logo
- **2.** Similarity: Concentric circles of dots
- **3.** Closure: World Wildlife Fund logo
- **4.** Enclosure/Common Regions: BlueCross menus
- **5.** Continuation: BlueCross logo
- **6.** Common Fate: Photo of jet planes
- **7.** Symmetry and Order: Adidas logo
- **8.** Figure-Ground: Silhouette of Batman

Now that students have a working definition of the Gestalt laws, give them a quick quiz to help them lock the laws into memory.

## 3. Student Do: Gestalt Laws Sample Quiz (5 min)

🌐**Online class:** Stop sharing your screen, switch to gallery view, and use the Raise Hands feature in Zoom to gather answers. Share your screen again before continuing.

We've reviewed the eight Gestalt laws. Now it's time to test the students' knowledge. Ask them which Gestalt law applies for each image shown.

- Share a sample image.

- Quiz the class using the slides provided.

- The answers follow:
  - Closure
![Closure.png](Images/Closure.png)
  - Figure/Ground
  ![Figure_Ground](Images/Figure_Ground.png)
  - Enclosure and Proximity
  ![Enclosure_Proximity.png](Images/Enclosure_Proximity.png)

> **Instructor Note:** Ask if there are any questions. Wait 30 seconds for questions to arise.

At this point, you've completed the first section of today's lesson—how Gestalt laws pertain to visual thinking and guide UI designers. Now that students have a grasp of the Gestalt laws, you'll pivot to moodboards in the next lecture.

- Tell students that designers create moodboards to reference good design reflecting the Gestalt laws.

## 4. Instructor Do: Moodboards With InVision (5 min)

> 📌 Your goal in this section is to help students practice curating moodboards for their UI design collections. There are many tools for this activity, including Pinterest. InVision lets students collaborate and share, and the instructional team can leave comments. This lecture and the following demo support the first learning objective of the day, constructing an InVision moodboard with five to 10 UI samples for each of the Gestalt laws.

Now that students understand that good design embodies Gestalt laws, they can learn how designers create moodboards for collecting ideas.

We'll use InVision to create our moodboards.

> **Instructor Note:** InVision calls moodboards "boards."

Designers obsessively collect visual reference materials. It's not too early in your students' UX/UI careers to capture reference material for inspiration. They should surround themselves with a high volume of quality resources and samples.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to explain how they've used moodboards.

### Moodboard in UI Design

A moodboard is a collage of images and objects to inspire UI design, as well as architectural, interior, graphic, and fashion design.

- When do UI designers use a moodboard?
  - Gathering inspiration is part of a designer’s continual practice. After collecting inspiration, UI designers use the moodboard for generating ideas (ideation) and creating models (prototype).

- Why do UI designers use a moodboard?
  - Clients often struggle to articulate visually what they want. This is the job of the UI designer. By using a moodboard for inspiration, we help clients obtain better design for their users.

- Share a personal experience helping a client make visual decisions with visual tools.
  - For example, a client requests green buttons (but really wants green velvet corduroy with 1970s piping). The designer uses a moodboard and gathers samples, with options in differing hues and materials. Contextual use will help clients be more specific about their design decisions.

- As UI designers, we're curators of experiences.
  - We should keep our ears to the ground and stay informed about developments in the UI world.

- Be a sponge and soak up as much as you can.
  - Every day, strive to learn something new about UIs and continue to collect samples that inspire you.

- One way to gather inspiration is by creating moodboards.
  - Ask: "**Does anyone already make moodboards?**"

  - Call on a student and ask how he or she makes moodboards.

  - There are many tools and software programs for creating inspiration:

    - Pinterest: [https://www.pinterest.com/](https://www.pinterest.com/)
    - Mural: [www.mural.co/](https://mural.co/)
    - Dropbox Paper: [https://www.dropbox.com/paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper)

  - **TAs,** slack out resources: [6 Great Tools for Creating Moodboards](https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/16-great-tools-creating-mood-boards-91412793)

- We already have InVision accounts and will be using them for InVision Boards. Students can link with the UI prototypes that they'll build later in the UI units.

- Open InVision Boards.

  - **TAs,** slack out: [https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/)

:briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Moodboards are an exploratory tool that shows others how you think as a visual designer and tell stories with your solution. They are highly sharable design deliverables, particularly during a job interview. You can share moodboards during case study walk-throughs at an interview or as proof that you do your research.

Seeing is believing. Now that students understand what moodboards are and their role in a designer's toolkit, let's show them how to build one in InVision.

## 5. Instructor Do: Demo - InVision Boards (10 min)

Students might understand the ***concept*** of a moodboard, but they aren't yet ready to build one of their own. In this demo, you'll show them how it's done.

Demonstrate how to create InVision Boards. Don't worry—most students are already familiar with InVision. Also, don't worry about being too thorough—students will practice with InVision Boards in the following activity.

**Part 1: Create a local folder and capture images.**

1. Create a folder in the class folder and label it "UI inspiration."

2. Go to [https://www.designspiration.net](https://www.designspiration.net/) and search for "user interface."

3. Open a new UI photo. Save the image (screenshot or control-click > Save Image As) and move it to your UI inspiration folder.

   - Quickly repeat with three to five other images.

**Part 2: Open InVision, create a board, and upload saved images.**

1. Log in to InVision.
2. Create a new board.

   ![InVision Create a Board](Images/05-InVision-Boards-Demo.gif)

3. Label the board "**UI Inspiration**."
4. Drag and drop to upload the three to five images from Part 1.

   ![InVision Board Add Images](Images/06-InVision-Drag-drop-images.gif)

5. Resize the uploaded samples.
6. Select into the image and review color palette and comments.

   ![InVision Boards Details Comments](Images/07-InVision-Image-Detail-Comments.gif)

7. Demonstrate how to add a section title.

![InVision Board Section Title](Images/08-InVision-Board-Section-Title.gif)

- **Ask,** "Any questions?"

- Recommend gathering inspiration as part of their daily routine. We'll practice this process over time as well.

Tell students, "Now it's your turn!"

It's all coming together. Students learned Gestalt laws, and they learned how to create InVision Boards. Now it's time to blend that learning and take action. In the following activity, students will create their moodboards with InVision and fill them with visual design images that embody Gestalt laws.

## 6. Student Do: Gestalt Laws in Practice Activity (15 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity:
[08-Week/02-Activities/08.2/08.2-01-Brand-Inspiration-Moodboard-Activity](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xE3H-5H1tmeJa4VmUz0KmoBQpImJvw6lUh3J91R1KQU)

**Instructor and TAs:** Check on students who might need help finding images, organizing an imagery file system, or getting their InVision Board launched and populated.

**Summary**

This activity helps students practice getting inspired like designers do—by collecting inspirational UI images. Students will gather images representing the Gestalt laws, organize them, and then add them to a moodboard.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Have students focus on just one Gestalt law at a time.

*For students who finish early*: This activity is extended during the weekly challenge, so encourage students to keep working on gathering more samples.

**Instructions**

Students will first gather inspirational UI images from the internet and organize them into folders on their computers. From there, they will create a moodboard using InVision, then bring selected images onto a moodboard, which they will label “UI Inspiration.”

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. During review, take volunteers to spotlight.

**Deliverable**

The final product is a moodboard created in InVision with images representing the Gestalt laws.

## 7. Instructor Do: Gestalt Laws in Practice Activity Review (10 min)

Call attention back and review students' InVision Boards.

- **Was everyone successful in creating an InVision Board?**
- **"Does anyone want to share?"**

Consider these discussion prompts:

- What worked? Why?
- What didn't work? Why not?
- What might you do differently next time?

- Discuss how creating moodboards and gathering inspiration is a big part of their challenge and their UI practice.

- Recommend making moodboards as a part of a daily routine:

  - For example, set aside the first 30 minutes of your day to gather UI samples.

  - Remember, **you are what you consume.** If you want to be good at UIs, study great UIs all the time.

- We'll spend a lot of time curating our digital worlds, which will benefit students well beyond this boot camp!

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they do an InVision board, for example:

  - Organization and proximity in visual moodboards are helpful. Move gestalt laws that are similar together. Or place all black and white samples together.
  - Rather than grabbing too many Gestalt samples from art or graphic design print materials, challenge yourself to apply this visual thinking to UIs, websites, and apps.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about moodboards or InVision. For example:

  - "Moodboard are only really used by visual designers as a tool for visual thinking." *False!* There is a wide spectrum of mood board use across industries from architecture to interior architecture to industrial design to marketing and advertising.

  - "Moodboards are too touchy feely and rarely connect to how a product gets designed." *False!* There is a wide range of quality when it comes to moodboards. If a team uses moodboards over time and curates their inspiration, they are incredibly valuable and practical design tools.  

At this point, students have a solid grasp of the Gestalt laws and building moodboards with InVision. Students have also achieved the first learning objective of the day: they've constructed a moodboard using InVision with visual design samples representing the Gestalt laws.

Well done.

The next step is for students to learn about the principles of design, or in other words, why good design works. This next step builds on their knowledge of the Gestalt laws by providing an under-the-hood view of Gestalt designs.

## 8. Instructor Do: Principles of Design (5 min)

> 📌 Your goal is to give students enough information to dive deeper during their practice with these design concepts. The principles of design form the foundation of graphic design and require *a lot* of practice to master.

Now it's time to put the Gestalt laws to work. Remind students that "Gestalt" asserts that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Here, you'll uncover the components that make up the whole of good design.

Before you dive in, say generally what the principles of UI design mean to designers.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Now share how you think about design principles more automatically since they've become instilled in you (this will remind students that what's new to them will become natural).

### Principles of UI Design

- Let's discuss what makes a design work or not, starting with the Seven UI Design Principles.

  - If students aren't familiar with the principles, remind them they'll need to dig deeper at home. Remind them to keep researching more than we have time to cover in class.

The Seven UI Design Principles:

1. Balance:

   - Each element in a composition carries visual weight. Use visual weight to create relationships between elements.

2. Proximity:

   - Group related items together so it's visually apparent they’re related. Our brains love organization, so when a graphic is organized appropriately, it's both visually appealing and easier to consume.

3. Alignment:

   - Every design element placed in a UI should be visually aligned to something else on the page. Nothing should be placed arbitrarily on an interface.

4. Repetition:

   - Repeating specific characteristics (e.g., fonts, colors, layouts, and design elements) within a design will keep the design unified and cohesive. Build visual themes that create unification and consistency.

5. Contrast:

   - Create contrast by making a specific element stand out or by drawing the viewer's eye to the most important aspect. Contrast creates more interest in the interface and makes certain aspects stand out among the rest.

6. White space:

   - White space is the absence of text and graphics. It's also called negative space.

   - White space in design calms the viewer, letting them pause and breathe.

7. Hierarchy:

   - A system or organization in which people, groups, or ideas are ranked one above the other according to status or authority. Viewers will start with the most dominant feature of a graphic, then move to the next dominant feature, and the next until they’ve taken in the entire graphic.

- This might be a lot for students to take in. Remind them that they'll be working with these principles and visual design ideas throughout the remainder of the five-week project—and their entire UX/UI careers.

- Tell students to go into their InVision Board and add section titles for each design principle we discussed.

  - Give students a few minutes and then continue.

  - Ask: "**Are there any questions about the Seven UI Design Principles?**

Now that students understand the building blocks of good design—design that follows the Gestalt laws—it's time for them to put everything into practice with a hands-on activity.

## 9. Student Do: Design Principles InVision Board Activity - Part 1 (10 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity, and read through the instructions with them:
[08-Week/02-Activities/08.2/08.2-02-Design-Principles-Moodboard-Google-Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRUy0ydCRBnlnhebg4cd-xYyNFgIeX05s11sq4l7BE4/edit?usp=sharing).

> Note: These activity instructions include Part 1 (LP section 9) and Part 2 (LP section 12) of this activity.

The goal is to practice capturing samples of the design principles we just covered in class.

**Instructor and TAs:** Help students who are struggling to organize their samples on their InVision Boards.

**Summary**

This is Part 1 of a two-part activity.

This activity provides practice collecting inspirational images, specifically those that embody the use of design principles.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Assist students with creating new sections in their InVision Boards and adding clear titles. As with Gestalt laws, have them start with one principle before moving on the next.

*For students who finish early*: Just as with the Gestalt laws, this activity is extended into challenge, so encourage students to keep finding samples.

**Instructions**

In Part 1, students will collect examples of four design patterns and add them to their InVision Boards.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. If students need more time with the activity, you can shorten the review time.

**Deliverable**

Students will submit sections of their InVision Boards, which will show good and bad examples of four design patterns.

## 10. Instructor Do: Design Principles InVision Board Activity - Part 1 Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

- Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

Ask students to share: "**Which design patterns did you choose and why?**"

- Ask the class: "**Which design principle do you think is the hardest to find samples for?**"

  - "**Are your samples UI-specific (screen-based) or generally graphic design (print materials, etc.)?**"

- We're in a UI class, so focus your eye to find samples relevant to what we'll build.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions.

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they work with design principles, for example:
  - Practice communicating about visual design decisions—learn to use the language (jargon) with expertise. For example: 
    - The difference between describing a layout as "this is beautiful" vs. "This layout balances the user eye with a clear relationship between the color and the CTA" can be the difference between communicating that you have used visual design effectively vs. got lucky.
- Work to become experts! Clients pay for expertise and your ability to "talk the talk" and walk the walk of other visual professionals is the difference between being great or just okay at your job.
  
- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about design principles. For example:

  - "Only graphic designers care about these principles." *False!* Anyone creating visual solutions can benefit from the ideas that underpin visual decisions.

  - "Design principles are not relevant to digital outputs." *False!* Design principles are universally applicable to any solution that has a visual design component.

Now that students have had hands-on practice with design principles, they need to go even deeper and learn design elements. A designer follows principles to arrange elements to create an aesthetic effect or convey a message.

> **Instructor Note:** Once you give the following lecture on design elements, students will return to the activity they just worked on to complete Part 2.

## 11. Instructor Do: Elements of UI Design (5 min)

> 📌 Your goal is to give students enough information to dive deeper during their practice of these design concepts. Elements of design are the foundation of graphic design and require *a lot* of practice. This lecture and the activity that follows supports today's second learning objective, collecting and organizing design principle samples into InVision Boards.

Building on what you just learned and practiced with design principles, you're going to go *even deeper* into the nitty-gritty, the building blocks of design.

We want you to avoid getting snagged by the nuances and complex aspects of the design elements, so we will concentrate on the *basics*.

### Elements of Design

Below are the 16 elements of design, based on Ellen Lupton's *Graphic Design: The New Basics*.

Of the 16, you will cover six (in **bold**, below).

> **Instructor Note:** We have a limited time to cover these topics in the boot camp. If students are new to visual design thinking, encourage them to explore all the elements over time, including more books and outside resources.

- **Point, Line, and Plane**
- Rhythm and Balance
- **Scale**
- Texture
- Color
- **Figure-Ground**
- Framing
- **Hierarchy and Contrast**
- **Layers**
- Transparency and Value
- **Modularity**
- Grid
- Pattern
- Diagram and Movement
- Time and Motion
- Rules and Randomness

**TAs,** slack out the link to *Graphic Design: The New Basics*: [https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Basics-Revised-Expanded/dp/161689332X/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=KR5BJXN7XEBFCFEKJ3XD](https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Basics-Revised-Expanded/dp/161689332X/ref=pdlpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=KR5BJXN7XEBFCFEKJ3XD)

- These elements cover all of graphic design, so let's focus on those elements most useful to UI designers.
  - We highly recommend practicing all of the design elements, but this boot camp is tailored for UI designers, not graphic designers, so we have to make the most of our time.
  - If you have no previous visual design background, becoming an expert in these is essential. You should do some extra reading on the web.
  - **TAs,** slack out:
    - [https://www.invisionapp.com/design-defined/elements-of-design/](https://www.invisionapp.com/design-defined/elements-of-design/)
    - [http://www.digital-web.com/articles/elements_of_design/](http://www.digital-web.com/articles/elements_of_design/)

- We'll cover six elements:

  - Point, Line, and Plane
  - Scale
  - Figure-Ground
  - Hierarchy and Contrast
  - Layers
  - Modularity

**Review each design element.**

> **Instructor Note:** Be a brief as possible as students will get a chance to practice these skills.

- **Point, Line, and Plane:**

  - These are the building blocks of design. Designers can create images, icons, textures, patterns, diagrams, animations, and typographic systems from these elements.

- **Scale:**

  - A graphic element can appear larger or smaller depending on the size, placement, and color of the elements around it. When elements are all the same size, the design feels flat. The contrast in size can create a sense of tension, as well as a feeling of depth and movement. Small shapes tend to recede; large ones move forward.

- **Figure-Ground:**

  - Elements have relationships that shape visual perception. A figure (form) is always seen in relation to what surrounds it (ground or background)—letters to a page, a building to its site, a sculpture to space within it and around it. A black shape on a black field is not visible; without separation and contrast, the form disappears.

- **Hierarchy and Contrast:**

  - This is the order of importance within a social group (such as the regiments of an army) or in a body of text (such as the sections and subsections of a book). Hierarchical order exists in nearly everything we know, including the workplace, politics, and religion. Indeed, the ranking of order in many ways defines who we are as a culture.

- **Layers:**

  - Layers are simultaneous, overlapping components of an image or sequence. They are at work in countless media software programs, from Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch to audio, video, and animation tools, where multiple layers of image and sound (tracks) unfold in time.

- **Modularity:**

  - Modularity is a special kind of constraint. A module is a fixed element used within a more extensive system or structure. For example, a pixel is a module that builds a digital image. Every design problem is completed within a set of constraints or limitations. Atomic and responsive design are assembling modular components.

- Wow, that was intense!

  > Recommend that students research the other 10 elements.

  - Recommend Ellen Lupton's *Graphic Design: The New Basics*.

- **TAs,** slack out the book URL:

  - [Graphic Design: The New Basics](https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Basics-Revised-Expanded/dp/161689332X/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=KR5BJXN7XEBFCFEKJ3XD)

:briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As UI designers, you will be expected to execute these design elements in your UI solutions, which takes practice. Once you have gained mastery, you should include these skills on your resume or LinkedIn skills.

- Pause for questions. Students are taking in a lot of information about a topic that can be hard for some to grasp. While this may click easily for some students, it will take others some practice before it sinks in.

> **Instructor Note:** Ask, "Any questions?" Wait 30 seconds for at least one question to arise before moving on.

## 12. Student Do: Design Elements InVision Boards - Part 2 (15 min)

**TAs:** Students are continuing to work from the activity instructions from the previous Google Doc activity:
[08-Week/02-Activities/08.2/08.2-02-Design-Principles-Moodboard-Google-Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRUy0ydCRBnlnhebg4cd-xYyNFgIeX05s11sq4l7BE4/edit?usp=sharing).

The goal is to practice capturing samples of the design elements we just covered in class.

**Instructor and TAs:** Help students who are struggling to organize their samples on their InVision boards.

**Summary**

This is Part 2 of the two-part InVision board activity.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Help students add each section for each design element. Have them work on one element at a time.

*For students who finish early*: Like the previous InVision boards, this work will be extended for challenge, so have students continue to add samples.

**Instructions**

In Part 2, students will collect examples of four design elements and add them to their InVision board.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep everyone in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. During the review, take volunteers to spotlight.

**Deliverable**

Students will submit sections of their InVision boards, which will show examples of four design elements.

## 13. Instructor Do: Design Elements InVision Boards Activity - Part 2 Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

- Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

Ask students to share: "**Which design patterns did you choose and why?**"

- Ask the class: "**Which design element do you think is the hardest to find samples of?**"

  - "**Are your samples UI-specific or design in general?**"

  - We're in a UI class, so focus your eye to find samples that are relevant to what we'll build.

- Ask if students have any questions.

At this point, you've just wrapped up the second section of tonight's lesson, the principles and elements of design and InVision Boards creation. Students have achieved the second learning objective, collecting design samples that represent design principles and design elements.

## 14. Break (10 min)

Take a break.

After the break, you'll be moving into the third section of tonight's lesson about color theory and creating color palettes.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Don't stop sharing your screen. Put up a Google timer or a YouTube timer video, which can help get students back into the Zoom room on time.

## 15. Instructor Do: Color Theory (7 min)

> 📌 Your goal is to give students enough information to dive deeper during their practice of these design concepts. Color is hard and highly subjective. Students will be working on these skills from now until the end of their careers. We will be covering subtractive color via pigment like CYMK and additive color RGB via light from screens.

You're about to introduce students to color theory. This is the third section of their "semester's worth of graphic design education" in one night. Their focus is becoming narrower—students have the design principles, which is a solid foundation for zeroing in on the specifics of color.

> Note: This is the first of three mini-lectures that run five to seven minutes in length. Each mini-lecture teaches a different aspect of color theory. There will be one activity between these mini-lectures and one at the end.

This is fun stuff: color theory, UI color, and color palettes, so jump right in!

Ask, "**Does anyone have a favorite color?"**

- Call on three students to share their favorite color and why.

Ask, "**Do you think your user cares what your favorite color is? Alternatively, your client?"**

- We are not designing for ourselves!

- However, understanding our own color biases and preferences is helpful, so let's get into it.

It's time to make sure all students get up to speed on UI color basics. We'll cover color theory quickly, so prepare your students for an accelerated pace.

- UI design uses color.

  - Obvious, right? However, communication using color is more complicated than you think.

**Color is essential.**

In the UI, color helps us define:

- Key interactions (buttons)
- Success, failure, and alerts
- Location and interaction state (navigation)
- UI branding

**Target's UI Buttons**
- Question: "**What color are Target's UI buttons?**

  - Call on a student. Answer: Red because of Target's logo and brand decisions.

- Are there any other brands that have unique colors?

- Color is everywhere, and our screens use the light spectrum to produce billions of shades.

  - RGB color uses additive light where all three together make white.
- As UI designers, we'll use primarily RGB.

### Three Main Components of Color

- Review color theory and the three components of color.

  - **Color hue:** A hue is a pure pigment—one without tint or shade (added white or black pigment, respectively).

  - **Color saturation (colorfulness):** Saturation is the purity of color. It is determined by a combination of light intensity and how much the color is distributed across the spectrum of different wavelengths.

  - **Color value:** Value is the intensity of the light (i.e., how light or dark it is).

### Color Wheel Differs Between Subtractive and Additive

1. RYB/CMYK: subtractive color from pigments.

   > Note: Most users will understand color from pigments, as that is what they learned in primary school.

   - CMYK - Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black in the printing world.

2. RGB: additive color for light.

   > Note: All screens are additive color.

**Subtractive Color Wheel**

- Review the color wheel.
- Discuss primary colors.
- Discuss secondary colors.
- Discuss tertiary colors.
- Discuss color temperature.

**Additive Color Wheel**

- Review the RGB color wheel.

  - Your ability to apply color effectively will be about defining screen colors.

  - Review RGB numbers and how they translate to HEX codes.

> Note: We'll cover this in much more depth during the coding units but encourage students to become familiar with defining color for developers.

### Color Is Cultural

- Christmas: red and green
- Hanukkah colors: blue, white, and silver
- Easter: red, white, green, purple, and yellow or gold
- Diwali (Hindu festival of lights): variety of festive colors

- Color is not easily mastered. As with everything else in the boot camp, practice, practice, practice.

### Color Harmonies

- Review the color harmonies.
- Say: "With this basic knowledge about colors and color schemes, you’re prepared to make effective branding decisions, like what color your logo should be. Alternatively, you can make color decisions based on the emotions that colors evoke in a consumer."

- Review complementary vs. analogous colors.

Now that students have a sense of the power of color and how directly it plays into design decision-making, it's time to go deeper. Let's learn about the psychology of color.

:briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Color has a level of sophistication that should apply to your resume and portfolio. Pick two to three colors to represent yourself.

## 16. Instructor Do: Color Psychology (8 min)

> 📌 Your goal is to discuss color and its use in society, culture, and in communicating in a UI. Quickly share personal experiences.

This next mini-lecture will build on color theory by covering the psychology of color, what humans associate with different colors, and how that influences design decisions.

### ROYGBIV 

- We're going to review **ROYGBIV,** an acronym that stands for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
- Review each color and how it makes us feel.
- **Red:** Red is stimulating and attention-grabbing.
  - Think passion, lust, anger, danger, adrenaline, or appetite.
  - Point out anyone with a red item of clothing.
- **Orange:** Orange is ambitious, fun, and energetic.
  - Think anticipation, endurance, cheer, warmth, optimism, or warning.
  - Ask: Is orange anyone's favorite color?
- **Yellow:** Yellow creates a mood of joy or aggravation.
  - Yellow is the most stimulating color and the first color the eye sees.
  - Think optimism, warmth, confidence, creativity, and positivity.
  - Never use yellow on a white background, or as your type color, unless on a dark background.
- **Green:** Green evokes connections to nature.
  - Think fresh, natural, healthy, and money.
- **Blue:** Blue is calming.
  - Think relaxation, depth, peace, serenity, trust, and religion.
  - Does anyone love the ocean?
  - Does anyone know why the sky is blue?
- **Purple:** Purple can indicate strength or be soothing.
  - Think spirituality, royalty, luxury, imagination, and playfulness.
  - Purple is also the color of royalty in Ancient Rome.
- **Black:** Black is bold and carries weight.
  - Think prestige, serious, classic, authority, power, and sophistication.
  - Dark UI is trending, but be mindful of trends.
- **White:** White is purity.
  - Think cleanliness, simplicity, virtue, and innocence.
  - Be mindful of how colors are perceived by different cultures as well.

- Take any questions. Remind students that they will have time to practice with color and that they should not expect to be color experts right out of the gate.

## 17. Instructor Do: Color and Usability (5 min)

:pushpin: Your goal in this lecture is building on color theory and color psychology by introducing color as it relates to usability. Color usability guides design choices when more than one color is used (which is always) for a design and branding.

### Color Impacts Usability

- Review color in usability.
- **No. 1** — Interactions and buttons
- **No. 2** — Feedback (success/failure/alert)
  - It is impossible to know how best to use without testing. Use your best judgment and then rely on your users' feedback to guide whether those decisions are working or not.
- **No. 3** — Location and interaction state
- **No. 4** — UI branding
  - High contrast
  - Low contrast

> Quick note: Find out whether your client hates the color green before you start your solution with green. Color can be fought over during design, and you want to build the best UI system throughout the process, which will require your clients' and users' buy-in.

:briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As UX/UI designers, you should be designing for all your users, and color is an incredibly meaningful communication tool. Apply color to your interactions, UIs, and brands thoughtfully to get noticed as well as tell a story of how your solutions are human-centered and accessible.

Now that students are building up their color theory knowledge, it's time to get interactive and test their recall. The following quick quiz will give them a chance to process what they've learned.

## 18. Instructor Do: Can't Unsee Online Quiz (2 min)

🌐**Online class:** Stop sharing your screen, switch to gallery view, and use the Raise Hands feature in Zoom to gather answers. Share your screen again before continuing.

### Run through the quiz

- **TAs,** slack out: [https://cantunsee.space](https://cantunsee.space)

- Run through this quick quiz with students and ask them to vote on the best answer.

### Review the Color Palette Tool Snapshot

**WHAT** is a color palette? 

A color palette is a type of visual presentation of the colors used for a project, brand, or product. 

**WHEN** do we use a color palette?

- Gathering inspiration on what colors your UI will use. 

- Establishing rules for visual design and usage.

**WHY** do we use a color palette?

- To create designs that are consistent and to use color to reinforce the UI interactions (buttons, forms, errors, etc).
- To create design colors that are as accessible as possible.
- To communicate how and why color is used.

Now that students have seen examples of the design principles and interacted a bit with them, let's shift the focus and demo Adobe Color CC.

## 19. Instructor Do: Demo - Adobe Color CC (5 min)

The goal here is to get students excited about Adobe Color Palette and show off how the tool works. Don't worry about being comprehensive—just give a quick tour.

- **TAs,** slack out: [https://color.adobe.com/](https://color.adobe.com/) and open.

1. Select the extract from an image tab.

   ![01-Adobe-CC-Color.png](Images/01-Adobe-CC-Color.png)

2. Upload an image from your desktop.
   ![02-Adobe-Color-CC-Image.png](Images/02-Adobe-Color-CC-Image.png)

3. Select Save Color Palette and sign into Adobe.

   ![03-Adobe-Color-CC-signin.png](Images/03-Adobe-Color-CC-signin.png)

4. Select Back to Color Wheel and explore moving color nodes around.

   ![04-Adobe-CC-Color-Wheel.png](Images/04-Adobe-CC-Color-Wheel.png)

- Ask students if they have any questions. Quickly move to the activity so that students can practice what you demonstrated.

Thanks to your demo, students have a sense of color theory and have seen what Adobe Color CC can do. In the following activities, students will use the Adobe Color CC tools to define their color palette and then define one for their government agency.

## 20. Student Do: Your Personal Color Palette (10 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity:
[08-Week/02-Activities/08.2/08.2-03-Color-Palette](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z0BFRz6jA-lkKl8ONE9K6ZL1iMylCV0AilDjYGREmIU/edit?usp=sharing).

**Instructor and TAs:** Make sure students split their time between Part 1 and Part 2 of this assignment so they don’t run out of time. Walk the room to answer questions and help students.

**Summary**

This activity gives students practice with color theory by creating color palettes.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Help students navigate the Adobe CC color website and encourage them to take screenshots to capture the color ideas.

*For students who finish early*: It should not be an issue, but have them create an Adobe CC color profile.

**Instructions**

This two-part activity uses Figma/Adobe XD. In Part 1, students will create a monochromatic color palette. In Part 2, students will create their personal color palette by uploading photos to Adobe Color CC.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. During review, take volunteers to highlight.

**Deliverable**

For Part 1, students will share a monochromatic color palette. For Part 2, students will share their “personal” color palette created in Adobe XD.

## 21. Instructor Do: Your Personal Color Palette Review (10 min)

Call attention back and review color findings.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Ask everyone to share their color palettes in Slack.

  - Call on two or three students to share:

  - **Did your past reveal something about your color future?**

  - **Is your favorite color in your palette?**

  - **Do you think five colors are too many?**

  - Have them share the webpage in Slack.
- If a student feels comfortable sharing the photo that they used to determine their color palette, have them share.

- Discuss how color is very personal and how understanding this is important when you are designing for other people, users, and clients.
- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they create a color palette.
- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about color palettes. For example:
  - "Color is arbitrary." *False!* Although color is literally in the eye of the beholder, it is learned and should be maintained with consistency.
  - "Color is too emotional." *False!* Color has the ability to evoke emotions from your users and should be sophisticated in its usage.

- We're going to spend a lot of time on color, so continue to refine your sensibilities.

> **Instructor Note:** There won't be a review after the next activity, so use this review to confirm that students are confident about creating color palettes.

## 22. Student Do: Government Agency Color Palette (10 min)

In this activity, students will use Adobe Color tools to define their government agency color palette.

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity:

- [08-Week/02-Activities/08.2/08.2-04-Government-Color-Palette](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RqFQEYtDH-Z04QHNHAAuBVs1IZQqZSHD2Dor0_OdYjo/edit?usp=sharing)

- [08.2-04-Brand-Colors-Adidas-Sample-Figma-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/Gx8n03vlydakNVSqwSHQ11/08.2-04-Brand-Colors-Adidas-Sample)

**Instructor and TAs:** This is a straightforward activity, but nevertheless, walk the room and be available for questions.

**Summary**

In this activity, students apply their new skills to create a color palette for their government agencies.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Have students start by defining one color plus white or black. Making decisions about an entire palette can be difficult out of context.

*For students who finish early*: Have students extend their color documentation with HEX amounts, RGB values, and convertible print CMYK values.

**Instructions**

Using their government agency website and other sites, students will browse the internet for inspiration for a color palette for their agency. They will save their samples to a folder and then use Adobe Color to create color palettes.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Get students who are working on the same government agency into Zoom breakout rooms. TAs can reference the agency selection template to establish these student groupings. Minimum two/maximum six. Assign TAs breakout rooms to assist. If students need more time, reduce the review time. The goal is not that they all agree on the same color palette but that they share their color rationale.

**Deliverable**

Students will develop and share a color palette to be used for their government agency redesign project.

## 23. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)

**Recap:**

The last two activities helped students complete the two final learning objectives for today:

- Capturing and identifying a personal color palette from a photograph using Adobe Color.
- Selecting and designing a UI color palette for a brand that represents primary, secondary, and tertiary interaction hierarchies.

**Review concepts:**

Spend a few minutes helping students anchor today’s learning. Ask students to raise their hands—or post answers in Slack—and offer definitions for the following concepts, all from today's class:

- Who can define the term "Gestalt theory"? (Answer: The whole of anything is greater than the sum of its parts.)
- Give an example of a Gestalt law. (Possible answers: proximity, similarity, closure, enclosure/common regions, continuation, common fate, symmetry and order, and figure-ground.)
- Give three to five examples of the Seven Principles of UI Design? (Possible answers: balance, proximity, alignment, repetition, contrast, white space, and hierarchy.)
- Give three to five examples of the six elements of design that we focused on today. (Possible answers: point, line, and plane; scale; figure-ground; hierarchy and contrast; layers; and modularity.)
- What did you learn about color? (Answer: We covered color theory, color psychology, color and usability, and color palettes.)

**At home:**

Everyone should be adding to the UI moodboards that they started in class today. Now is the time to develop this lifelong practice.

**Office hours:**

Remind students that office hours are for the next 30 minutes.
