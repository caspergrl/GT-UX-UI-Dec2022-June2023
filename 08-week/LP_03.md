# 8.3 Lesson Plan: Typography and UI Grids

## Overview

Students will learn and practice working with typography and UI grids, building on their design knowledge from the prior class. Designing effective, attractive typography is an essential skill for improving readability, accessibility, and overall usability.

Lesson 8.1 introduced UI analysis and design. Lesson 8.2 covered graphic design principles and taught students to recognize good design and identify which elements of design are in play. Today, Lesson 8.3 will round out the unit by covering typography, type styles, UI grids, and building grids in Figma/Adobe XD. All together, Unit 8 enables students to gain a foundation in visual design that will carry over to the rest of the UX/UI Boot Camp and students' careers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Choose primary and secondary type families from Google Fonts and Figma/Adobe XD type styles, including serif and sans serif typefaces, and analyze and apply them to an existing webpage.
2. Explain the underlying logic and layout of a popular website revealed by applying a UI grid.
3. Design a UI grid and articulate how it improves UI design.
4. Reproduce a landing page as a wireframe using color, typography, Gestalt laws, and a UI grid.

## Class at a Glance

- Welcome to Lesson 8.3 on typography and UI grids.

- The knowledge and skills taught today are a foundation for UI and front-end development projects, giving students the skills to structure, layout, and organize content that users will consume.

- Today's class is a continuation of our study of UI design fundamentals. It is divided into three parts:

  - Part 1 will introduce typography.
  - Part 2 will cover UI grids.
  - Part 3 will provide students with practice using typography and grids in desktop layouts.

By the end of today's class, students should grasp these UI basics and how they relate to UI design decisions.

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: üåê) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class‚Äôs focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

üåê **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students‚Äô feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.‚Äù
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: ‚ÄúBear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.‚Äù

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activity and review sections by doing some activities as a class instead of creating breakout groups.  

## Preparing for Class

- Review the slides for the lecture: [08-Week/01-Slides/08.3-Typography and Grids Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CgJ1WBf3IMxJWkfZIK3Xo-HZSx3uc0doHL2udpdmrGc).
- Be sure to read through the entire lesson plan, slides, student activity files, and the Time Tracker‚Äîand make notes so that you're thoroughly prepared to teach and support students.

- You will give three demos in class, so be sure to run through them in advance:
  - A demo of Google fonts (Section 4)
  - A demo of Chrome's Design Grid Overlay Extension (Section 12)
  - A demo of Figma/Adobe XD Grids (Section 14)

- Prepare to be engaged with your students' progress by:
  - Working with your teaching assistants (TAs) to help students.
  - Paying close attention to students' individual needs.
  - Encouraging the use of office hours to gain more feedback.
  - Sharing UI resources and encouraging students to practice often.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Today's Objectives (5 min)

- First, open up the slides for the lecture: [08-Week/01-Slides/08.3-Typography and Grids Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CgJ1WBf3IMxJWkfZIK3Xo-HZSx3uc0doHL2udpdmrGc).
- **TAs:** Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.
- ***Say:*** UI will continue to get harder, but we're here to help you gain these skills. Your growth will be astounding, but it will take work.

- Next, **provide context and set the tone for today's learning** about typography and UI grids.

  - Today's lesson is all about how objects occupy space. First, you'll cover how type occupies space and how objects occupy space on a webpage using UI grids.
  - We are covering *type* first because it is the foundation on which all other UI pieces are built. Help students grasp how foundational type is with the following examples:




    - Typography styles and choices are meaningful for screen legibility and human-centered ideas. A good font can be the difference between getting your users to read your UI or having them have usability issues.

    - Typography pairings can assist in communication and UI branding. There are thousands of fonts, and using fonts that work well together is the key to improving a UI brand expression.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how you think about type and objects in your work.

**Lastly, walk through today's objectives.**

- Today's lesson connects to students' UX learning from the early weeks in a few ways. For example:

  - Design thinking requires having empathy for the user through the process from definition, ideating, prototyping, and testing. Today, students will get more practice in this by making typography decisions and thinking about what their user needs.

  - Without an effective grid, good typography, and caring about your user, solutions are very hard to get right. Today's skills will add on top of UX to improve the UI.

  - Typography and layout grids are hard visual skills they'll use for the rest of their careers.

## SLIDE 5
### Typography 101

- As UI designers, we're responsible for much decision making.

  - We should keep our ears to the ground to stay informed about developments in the UI world and to improve how type is used in interfaces.

- Typography is 90% of a webpage.

  - Your users read the type we communicate with, so if you don't care about typefaces, your user won't care about your website.

- **TAs,** slack out: [https://www.fontsmith.com/blog/2016/06/29/the-a-z-of-typographic-terms](https://www.fontsmith.com/blog/2016/06/29/the-a-z-of-typographic-terms).

## SLIDE 6
**Kerning**
Kerning is the spacing between individual letters or characters. Adjusting this from the typeface's default should be done with caution. Too much or too little kerning can result in a poor UX.

**Ascender**
Refers to the upward stem part of lowercase letters that extends beyond the meanline (top of x-height) a font. These ascending pieces may also be referred to as as arches, stems, or hooks, depending on the shape of the form they reflect. Examples of common letters with ascenders are b, d, f, h, i, k, l, and t.

The level that ascenders reach is known as the 'ascent line'. Also, take note that capital letters do not technically have any ascenders.

**X-Height**
The x-height is the same height as the lowercase letter 'x' in a font, and that's where it gets its name. The distance between the baseline and the meanline is considered the x-height.

**Baseline**
The baseline is an imaginary line that letters or words lie on.

**Descender**
The opposite of an ascender... the 'tail' or downward portion of a letter that extends below the baseline. The descender's height is calculated from the baseline to the end of the font descender line.

Font descenders can also be found in capital letters, numbers, and special characters. Most descenders belong to lowercase letters such as g, j, q, p, or y‚Äîand sometimes f and z. However, at times you might also find them on the capital letters Q, Y, or J, and they typically appear in italicized letters or the old-style numerals 3, 4, 5, 7, or 9. It depends on the typeface.

**Leading**
Line height is the vertical distance between two lines of type, measured from the baseline of one line of type to the baseline of the next. Traditionally, in metal type, this was the combined measurement of the font size and the strips of lead that were inserted between each row (called ‚Äúleading‚Äù) of type.

**Cap Height**
The height of a typeface's uppercase letters, measured from the baseline to the top of flat-topped glyphs. This is usually slightly lower than the ascender height, and cap height can vary between typefaces.


## SLIDE 7
Review

## SLIDE 8
Regarding sizing of typefaces:  
- For screens, it is in pixels or rems.
  - For print, it is in points.

  - Type should be:
    - Appropriate to the content (think about the differences between a bank's typeface vs a child's toy).
    - Legible and clear (fancy, scripted fonts are best left as decorative elements, not for readability in websites or applications).
    - Scalable and designed for the screen.

## SLIDE 10

**WHAT** is typography classification?

There are five basic classifications of typefaces: serif, sans serif, script, monospaced, and display. Monospaced typefaces are generally used for displaying code, though they can also be used for body and headline copy, and were originally used on typewriters. 

**WHEN** do we use typography classification?

- Gathering inspiration on what typography your user interface will use. 
- Establishing rules for visual design and text usage.
- When searching for type both on your computer and through online libraries.

**WHY** use typography classification? 

- To create designs are consistent and use typography classifications to reinforce the UI interactions (buttons, forms, errors, etc).
- To use typography that is as accessible as possible.
- To communicate how and why typography is used.

## SLIDES 11
Review

## SLIDE 12
Serif fonts can look authoritative, professional, and suggest the weight of history or experience. Serif typefaces like Times New Roman are suggestive of typewriters‚Äô old style ‚Äî The New York Times and other reputable institutions that have existed for over a century still use this font.  

Serifs aren‚Äôt just aesthetic, though. They also have real functional value as body copy and often lend a bit more legibility at smaller scales. When reading a small typeface in a printed book, serifs can help with distinguishing more easily between the letterforms.

## SLIDE 13
Sans serif fonts are mostly associated with modern typefaces (even though they've been around for close to a century now).

Sans serif typefaces were controversial when they first appeared and were sometimes called ‚Äúgrotesque‚Äù typefaces. But when modernist designers like the Bauhaus movement embraced them, they became associated with cutting-edge design, commerce and modernism.

They work well where there‚Äôs very little room for copy. Signs, text in apps, and names on maps tend to be sans serif though there are some exceptions.

When building an app or designing a site, sans serifs are generally a good way to go as they're easier to read on small or low resolution screens. 

## SLIDE 14
Monospaced typefaces are ones in which all or most characters take up the same amount of horizontal space. Code editors use monospaced typefaces by default.

As evidenced on any monospaced typeface (originally produced for typewriters), there are a number of common stylistic touches on common characters to account for this shared width, such as serifs on top of the stem on a lowercase ‚Äúi,‚Äù or a heavily condensed lowercase ‚Äúm.‚Äù

## SLIDE 15
Script fonts are designed to capture the flourish and artistry of traditional hand lettering and calligraphy, usually as if written with a pen, brush, or marker. Script fonts are usually decorative in nature and most should be used like one would use a display font, which is to make a statement rather than set text. They are popular with stationery, logotypes, branding, and poster design, and script fonts can be paired with a range of other font styles to create different moods. 

## SLIDE 16
A display font is a broad category of fonts that are designed for short-form and often large-format applications, such as billboards or posters; logotypes; headlines or headings in magazines or websites; and book covers. Display fonts transcend styles‚Äîthey can be a serif font, slab serif, didone, script, sans serif, and so on. Many typefaces are designed purely as display fonts and given a range of decorative features. Some typefaces, will include a display version in which the original design is embellished or exaggerated for use at larger sizes.

Questions??

## SLIDE 20
- **TAs,** slack out and open [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- 
- Discuss how this is a free-ish resource from Google.

- Select a few fonts.

- Download the .zip file.

- Install fonts on your computer.

> **Instructor Note:** Installing fonts on Mac and PC is very different. TAs, monitor and help students install fonts. For Mac, refer to: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749). For PC, refer to: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/314960/how-to-install-or-remove-a-font-in-windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/314960/how-to-install-or-remove-a-font-in-windows).

- Next, we'll turn students loose to gather type samples on their own.

***Learn by doing:*** Now that students understand how critical typography is to good design and watched you download families of Google fonts, it's time for them to try it out themselves. The following activity will guide them through downloading fonts and thinking critically about their attributes.

## 5. Student Do: InVision Board Typography Inspiration Using 'Lazy Dog' Type Samples Activity (15 min)

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Google Doc activity file:

- [08-Week/02-Activities/08.3/08.3-01-LazyDog-Type-Samples-Matrix-Activity Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NUmj84RdtDwuW2J4MrCse1iCrcdIuVPyKYCWVWXjmV8/edit?usp=sharing)

- [08.3-01-Type-Samples-Figma-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/FVICVwKTm7xeHsOfvyUW1Y/08.3-01-Type-Samples-Template)

**Instructor and TAs:** Students might need help importing their fonts. Monitor the students and offer help to keep them moving through this brief activity.

**Summary**

Students will learn how to import fonts as well as analyze their attributes against other fonts.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Have students start with default typefaces first. They can try using Helvetica or Roboto as a baseline to see other sans serif font families.

*For students who finish early*: Unlikely, but keep encouraging students to bookmark type they want to explore.

**Instructions**

Students will work alone for this activity, which has three parts. First, students find fonts that exemplify a variety of typography. Next, they'll assign nine different fonts to the phrase, ‚ÄúThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.‚Äù Finally, they'll score the fonts as guided by the scoring column in the activity instructions and rank them according to their scores.

üåê **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. During review, take volunteers to highlight.

**Deliverable**

Students will share a PDF of their completed matrix, containing nine unique fonts and scores for each.

## 6. Instructor Do: InVision Board Typography Inspiration Using 'Lazy Dog' Type Samples Activity Review (5 min)

Now it's time to take a look at how successful students were in downloading type sets and analyzing them. This is an opportunity to correct any misunderstandings students have about typography and working with fonts.

Call attention back and review InVision Boards.

:globe_with_meridians: **Onlie Recommendation:** Since students can‚Äôt physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- **Was everyone successful at gathering type samples?**

- **Does anyone want to share their Figma/Adobe XD Type matrix?**

- Quickly discuss how gathering samples is also about using those samples. Using samples effectively is a big part of their challenge as well as their UI practice.

- DO NOT choose a typeface for your UI without testing it with your users. You are solving legibility issues for your users and need to get their feedback.

- Typography has thousands of options. Remember that you'll probably work with a graphic designer who will care more about this than other team members.

> **Instructor Note:** Share your favorite font if you have one.
>
> Example: San Serif - **DIN - Medium** for its proportional numbers.

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they try this skill, for example:

  - Do not use a Display typeface for body copy.
  - Test your type decisions all the time! What you personally like might not be what your user or your client likes. Don't be too stubborn with your typography choices.

Now that they've worked with typeface a bit, it's time to share a few best practices to deepen what they know. The following lecture will be your final stop on this whirlwind tour of type.


## SLIDE 26
Review

## SLIDE 27
### Hermann Zapf
- Hermann Zapf was a German type designer and the inventor of Optima, Zapfino, and Palatine fonts used widely in brochure, catalog, book, and magazine publishing and, now, site and app design. Little-known fact: he was married to a calligrapher!

"Typography is a two-dimensional architecture based on experience and imagination and guided by rules and readability. And this is the purpose of typography: the arrangement of design elements within a given structure should allow the reader to easily focus on the message without slowing down the speed of his reading.""


## SLIDE 28
1. Limit your typefaces per design
2. Consider the typeface and color contrast together


## SLIDE 29
3. F reading pattern   
In the F-shaped scanning pattern is characterized by many fixations concentrated at the top and the left side of the page. Specifically:

Users first read in a horizontal movement, usually across the upper part of the content area. This initial element forms the F‚Äôs top bar.

Next, users move down the page a bit and then read across in a second horizontal movement that typically covers a shorter area than the previous movement. This additional element forms the F‚Äôs lower bar.

Finally, users scan the content‚Äôs left side in a vertical movement. Sometimes this is a slow and systematic scan that appears as a solid stripe on an eyetracking heatmap. Other times users move faster, creating a spottier heatmap. This last element forms the F‚Äôs stem.
The implications of this pattern are:

First lines of text on a page receive more gazes than subsequent lines of text on the same page.
First few words on the left of each line of text receive more fixations than subsequent words on the same line.

4. Z eye flow  
Users don‚Äôt read web pages, they scan.
A z-pattern design traces the route the human eye travels when they scan the page‚Äî left to right, top to bottom:

First, people scan from the top left to the top right, forming a horizontal line
Next, down and to the left side of the page, creating a diagonal line
Last, back across to the right again, forming a second horizontal line
When viewers‚Äô eyes move in this pattern, it forms an imaginary ‚ÄúZ‚Äù shape.

This pattern works because most western readers will scan your page the same way that they would scan a paper sheet ‚Äî top to bottom, left to right.

Z-Pattern scanning occurs on pages that aren‚Äôt centered on the text (for text-heavy pages such as articles or search results, it‚Äôs better to use F-Pattern). This makes z-pattern good solution for simple designs with a minimal copy and a few key elements that need to be seen. Minimalist pages or landing pages centering mostly around one or two main elements can implement the Z-pattern to make the procedure of page scanning much easier for site‚Äôs visitors.

5. Type weight and visual hierarchy  
Typographic hierarchy shows the reader which information to focus on‚Äîwhich is most important and which is simply supporting the main points... use size and weight to help establish priority

6. Type spacing and white space  
White space is the area between design elements. It is also the space within individual design elements, including the space between typography glyphs (readable characters). Despite its name, white space does not need to be white. It can be any color, texture, pattern, or even a background image.

## SLIDE 31
7. Meaningful type styling:  
   - Type styles should be thoughtfully considered and appropriate to the subject matter. Save wildly experimental styles for personal projects.

8. Legibility above all else:
   - Don't confuse your reader.

**Instructor and TAs:** Circulate around the room, just in case students get stuck.

**Summary**

Students will gain an appreciation for how dramatically a font can alter the look and feel of a blog post or article online.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Encourage the use of the grid and starting with a simple type hierarchy, an H1 and p first.

*For students who finish early*: Encourage them to help their neighbor or experiment with very different type choices.

**Instructions**

This is a five-part activity. In Part 1, students will install the Adobe XD plugin or open Figma. In Part 2, students will select an article or blog post with typography they want to redesign. In Part 3, they'll choose two typefaces and install the fonts. In Part 4, they'll set up a grid layout and redesign the article or blog post. In Part 5, they'll complete their work and share in Slack.

üåê **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. During review, take volunteers to highlight.

**Deliverable**

Students will recreate a blog post or article with new typography (and save it as a PNG file).

Call the class back to attention.

:globe_with_meridians: **Onlie Recommendation:** Since students can‚Äôt physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Ask individuals to share their new article type designs:

  - Call on a few students.

  - Share their solutions over the projector.

- Ask:

  - "**Which fonts did you choose and why?**"

  - "**Which type tips did you apply?**"

  - We are in a UI class, so focus your eye to find type use that is relevant to what we'll build.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause here and ask if students have any questions. Wait 30 seconds for questions to arise.

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they work with type. For example:

  - Typography decisions are rarely made as characters alone. Show how the font works on your websites, products, or services. Fonts have purpose and should be used with "real" language and actual copy to test its function.

  - Typography should be legible first and foremost. If you care about your user, you will make the words user-legible.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about type for UI. For example:

  - "Only graphic designers care about typography." *False!* Designers might be able to call typefaces by name, but *everyone* interacts with type.
  - "Custom typography is expensive." *False!* There is a wide range of typography costs for businesses as well as thousands of free typefaces to use.

This wraps up the first section on typography. Students have achieved the first of today's learning objectives: learning to choose primary and secondary type families from Google Fonts and Figma/Adobe XD typestyles, including serif and sans serif types, and applying them to an existing blog or webpage.

## SLIDE 39
- Whenever we design screens‚Äîfor helping users get around, buy goods, or communicate with their loved ones‚Äîit all starts with thinking about the layers and how they grid.


**WHAT** are layout grids?

Layout grids are used for design projects that have as little as one page or as many as hundreds. Grids help organize elements inside a space and create logic for managing content.

**WHEN** to use layout grids?

- Laying out any screen or designing any product. 
- Establishing rules for visual design and text usage.
- Organizing page content and establishing content hierarchy.

**WHY** use layout grids?

- Grids underpin all design and layout decisions.
- Grids establish a framework and set of rules for designing between screens.
- To communicate how and why a layout is used.

## SLIDE 48
A grid is the foundation for order in a design. Proportion, rhythm, white space and hierarchy are all design characteristics that directly affect cognitive speed. Grids create and enforce consistency of these elements throughout an interface. An effective grid guides the eye, making it easier and more pleasant to scan objects on the screen. 

## SLIDE 49
**Format and margin:**
   - The format is the area in which the design is placed.
   - In a paper book, the format is the page. On the web, the format is the size of the browser window.
   - Margin is the negative space between the edge of the format and the outer edge of the content.

## SLIDE 50
**Columns:**
    - Columns are vertical divisions of space. They are the main building blocks of grids.

**Rows:**
    - Rows are the horizontal equivalent of columns.

## SLIDE 51
**Module and spatial zones:**
    - Modules are individual units of space created from the intersection of columns and rows.
    - Groups of adjacent modules in vertical and horizontal areas create spatial zones or regions.

**Gutters:**
    - Gutters refer to the space between columns and rows.

‚ÄúIn sketching a grid, care must be taken to ensure that the sketch corresponds as closely as possible to the proportions of the final printed (coded) format. Only in this way is it possible to gradually acquire the ability to produce, even in little sketches, typographic patterns that are realistic (i.e., which can be transferred to the final format without difficulty).‚Äù

  - Josef M√ºller-Brockmann was a famous Swiss graphic designer who wrote books on the importance of grids in design systems and has produced countless posters using fantastic grids. If students don't know him or Swiss design, share resources and encourage at-home research.

## 12. Instructor Do: Demo - Chrome's Design Grid Overlay Extension (5 min)

In this activity, students install the Design Grid Overlay extension to see how existing webpages have applied grids to their layouts.

**TAs,** slack out to students the following Chrome extension and walk through how to overlay a grid on a website:
[Chrome's Design Grid Overlay extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-grid-overlay/hajfilceeneohkmcakehndmaeonhlack/related?hl=en/).

1. Install Chrome's Design Grid Overlay extension.
2. Go to a website of your choice.
3. Launch the Design Grid Overlay extension and modify the grid setting to find the grid of your chosen webpage.

Involve your class in the demo:

- Ask, **Did you not see the underlying grid?**
- Discuss how the lack of a grid can be painful, but also how too much of a grid can make a website feel too rigid.

:gem: **Designer Insight:** This is a great time to talk about how the value of using a grid layout "clicked" for you as a designer. Your anecdotes are students' connection to the real world.

- Encourage students to look at websites and apps every day‚Äîwith the grid layout in mind:
  - They must look at everything now through "UI grid goggles."
  - We're going to spend a lot of time with UI layouts, so it's essential to learn to quickly recognize UI grids in the wild.

Now that students have a sense of grids, it's time to get into some of the specifics underlying UI grids‚Äîthe number of grids and the use of the standard 12-column grid.

## SLIDE 61
12-column grids are highly versatile due to being most easily divisible among reasonably small numbers. It's possible to have 12, six, four, three, two or one evenly spaced column. 

While the 12-column grid is a popular choice among many designers, it‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all solution. When you choose a grid, select one with the number of columns you really need for your design. There‚Äôs no point in using a 12-column grid if your layout needs only 8 columns.

    - For example, 6 + 6 (two-column layout), 4 + 4 + 4 (three-column), 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 (four-column), 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 (six column), etc. The 12-column system allows for multiple options.

## 14. Instructor Do: Demo - Figma/Adobe XD Grids (5 min)

Show students how designers use grids for site design. You'll share two methods to create a grid:

- Repeat grid tool. (Adobe XD only)

- Built-in layout grid on the artboard. (Figma/Adobe XD)

![XD Grid Tools](Images/01-XD-grid-tools.gif)

**Demo Instructions**

1. Download the Adobe XD - UX-Grids-Template.xd:

   - [https://drive.google.com/open?id=11xu24qf-Ai8cEOGuqcMzKKJLAtGnDKgS](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11xu24qf-Ai8cEOGuqcMzKKJLAtGnDKgS)

2. Open Adobe XD and then open the file.

3. Part 1: Quickly demonstrate using the repeat grid tool.

   - Show modifying gutters.
   - Show changing the width of columns.
   - Create a new desktop artboard.

   ![Adobe XD New Artboard](Images/02-XD-New-Artboard.gif)

   - Draw a rectangle column and then make a new grid.

   ![Adobe XD Repeat Grid](Images/03-XD-Repeat-Grid.gif)

4. Part 2: Quickly demonstrate using the artboard grid layout.

   - Turn the grid on and off.
   - Change the column number and size.
   - Modify margins and gutters.

   ![Adobe XD Artboard Grid](Images/04-XD-Artboard-grid.gif)

Setting up artboards and understanding the underlying grid logic speeds up designers' UI design process.

Now that students have seen how a grid is created‚Äîin two ways‚Äîgo a bit deeper by explaining grid logic.

## SLIDE 63
### Four Types of Grid Logic

- Grids start to bring order and logic to the information we're trying to build into our UIs.

1. **Symmetrical grid logic:**
   - There are equal parts on each side of a composition. Symmetry can be horizontal or vertical or both.
   - Point out the column logic.
2. **Asymmetrical grid logic:**
   - A base grid of odd numbers (e.g., a 15-column grid will result in more asymmetric compositions).
   - Point out the column logic.

## SLIDE 64
3. **Modular grid logic:**
   - Using both columns and rows. Typically seen with card layouts or similarly sized objects in the composition.
   - Point out the column and row logic.
4. **Hierarchical grid logic:**
   - More complicated. Relies on visual dominance and a top-down compositional structure.

> **Instructor Note:** This activity file contains the instructions for Part 1 (see Section 16) and Part 2 (see Section 18).

**Instructor and TAs**

This activity has several steps, and most students will appreciate the help. Monitor and support the students.

*Tips for students who struggle*: With your TAs, support students who need some more help getting their grids set up. Focus on a 12-column grid.

*For students who finish early*: Have them build more grids. They should be practicing grid creation or building templates they can user over and over again.

**Summary**

This activity gives students hands-on practice translating a UI grid from a website into a wireframe layout. The goal is to get students to quickly define a layout using grid logic while executing and articulating which grid logic they are using.

üåê **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. During review, take volunteers to highlight.

**Instructions**

This activity has several steps. Students will find a website to use for this activity and set up its UI grid in Figma/Adobe XD.

**Note:** The activity instructions have illustrations that will be helpful to students.

**Deliverable**

The deliverable comes at the end of Part 2.

## 17. Instructor Do: Figma/Adobe XD Grid Creation and Layout Challenge - Part 1 Review (5 min)

Now that students have had a chance to practice two different approaches to creating a UI grid in Figma/Adobe XD, talk as a group to find out how it went and what they learned.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Onlie Recommendation:** Since students can‚Äôt physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.
>
> - Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

Call attention back and review UI grid layout samples. Be brief, but discuss three to four examples from your students' work.

- Start by having students review other students' grids and layouts.

- Have students share layout .png files in Slack #inclass chat.

- Choose a layout sample and call on the student.

- **Tell us about this grid. Why did you execute this way?**

- **Was making grids easy or hard?**

- Quickly discuss how grid logic can quickly help determine a layout.

- **Did anyone use an uneven grid number?**

  - Did they produce an asymmetrical layout? The grid logic will help determine the logic for how content will get laid out.

- We're going to spend a lot of time with UI layouts, so get good at not only recognizing UI grids but also using them in your page layouts.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a personal experience with using grids to design faster.

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they practice grids, for example:

  - Grids should have clear distinctions between column and gutter.
  - Help students use math effectively so they are thinking about screen proportions as part of their layout decisions; i.e., a 12-column grid can be split into halves (6 and 6), thirds (4, 4, and 4), or quarters (3, 3, 3, and 3), etc.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about grids in Figma/Adobe XD. For example:

  - "Great designers don't need a grid as they just intuit the layout." *False!* Every designer uses a grid.
  - "Grids are not important to developers." *False!* Developers want defined rules for which to code a design and size is essential to grids.

In the following activity, students will create a new UI grid like the ones they just created in Figma/Adobe XD, and use it as the basis for recreating a webpage design.

## SLIDES 70-71
## 18. Student Do: Figma/Adobe XD Grid Creation and Layout Challenge - Part 2 (20 min)

***This is a continuation of the previous activity (Section 16).***

**TAs:** For Part 2, students should continue using the same document from Section 16:
- [08-Week/02-Activities/08.3/08.3-03-XD-UI-Grid-Creation-Layout-Challenge-Activity-Instructions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WZit7FJr9etdn2bb7vxHHqhhXGaDfJaUBj9vU4jzJUc)

**Summary**

If students are very new to Figma/Adobe XD, have TAs assist them and make sure they're doing tutorials at home to be able to keep up in class.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Have students get out a sheet of paper and make thumbnail sketches of the options they are seeing. Offer this flexibility for students who struggle with how "permanent" designs feel inside of design software.

*For students who finish early*: Have them help their neighbors.

**Instructions**

This is a continuation of the previous activity. Students will create a high-level layout by creating a representative wireframe of the webpage using Figma/Adobe XD.

üåê **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. During review, take volunteers to highlight.

**Deliverable**

Students will create a wireframe layout that represents the design of a webpage.
They'll submit three artifacts: a screenshot of their webpage, a .png of their webpage with a grid overlay, and a .png of their wireframe layout.

## SLIDE 72
## 19. Instructor Do: Figma/Adobe XD Grid Creation and Layout Challenge - Part 2 Review (10 min)

This is your final group review of the day. Be sure to encourage questions. Invite any students who don't feel confident about typography or UI grids to stay after class for office hours.

Have students review their classmates' grids and layouts in Slack.

:globe_with_meridians: **Onlie Recommendation:** Since students can‚Äôt physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

Review three to four samples as a group.

- Choose a layout sample and call on the student.

- **Tell us about this grid. Why did you execute this way?**
- **Was making grids easy or hard?**

- Quickly discuss how grid logic can quickly help determine a layout.

- **Did anyone use an uneven grid number?**
- Did they produce an asymmetrical layout? The grid logic will help determine the logic for how content will get laid out.

- We're going to spend a lot of time with UI layouts, so get good at not only recognizing UI grids but also using them in your page layouts.

- Share a personal experience with using grids to design faster.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions. This is a good time to invite students to stay after class to work on today's concepts.

At this point, you've not only wrapped up your third and final section of the lesson plan (applying UI grids), but students have also achieved their fourth and final learning objective: reproducing a webpage by applying UI principles and a UI grid.

## 20. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)

> :pushpin: Your goal here is to help students use memory recall to strengthen their learning and remember today's concepts.

You did it!

### Review Concepts

Spend a couple of minutes helping students anchor today‚Äôs learning by asking them to raise their hands‚Äîor post answers in Slack‚Äîand offer definitions for the following concepts, all learned today in class:

1. What are three types of type? (Answers: serif, sans serif, and monospaced.)

2. What are three to four of the typography tips we discussed in class? (Answers: limit your typefaces, typography and color contrast, reading patterns/heat map, Z eye flow, type weight/visual hierarchy, type spacing/white space, style meaningfully, and don't confuse your reader.)

3. What is the value of a UI grid? (Answers: clarity/order, efficiency, economy of scale, and consistency/harmony.)

4. How many columns do most UI grids have? (Answer: 12 columns.)

5. What are two ways that you can set up grids in Figma/Adobe XD? (Answers: rectangle repeat and applying an Figma/Adobe XD artboard grid.)

6. What are two to four types of grid logic you can recall? (Answers: symmetrical, asymmetrical, modular, and hierarchical.)

### Reminders

- Remind students that they should be making progress on their **challenge**.
- Remember, after-class office hours are for the next 30 minutes.

Take any remaining questions.

Wish everyone a good night.
