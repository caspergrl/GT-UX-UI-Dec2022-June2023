# 14.1 Lesson Plan: Group Project 2, Day 4

---

## Overview

Today, students will continue working on Group Project 2. They will work on user flows, wireframes, and responsive web design (RWD) user interface (UI) prototypes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Practice a daily stand-up.

2. Build a user flow.

3. Discuss feedback from at least two instructional staff members on their user flow.

4. Sketch mid-level wireframes for their nonprofit solutions.

5. Build a clickable prototype in InVision or Adobe XD.

## Class at a Glance

- The goal of the second week of Group Project 2 is for groups to make progress on their UI prototypes. Each group should focus on UI prototyping, testing, and iterating from low and mid fidelity to high fidelity.

  - Groups need time for feedback from you and the teaching assistants (TAs). Also, encourage groups to share their work quickly with other teams or "real" users.

- Today is a working session for students. Be sure to conduct a stand-up, to workshop with student groups throughout the class, and to help students if they get stuck.

## Preparing for Class

- Review lecture slides [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/14.1 Project 2, Day 4 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TUdAIKKuab6IuEIhKmS5msgRXcDr_8HNwBxcDalnoWA/edit?usp=sharing).

- If a group falls behind schedule, assign a TA to actively workshop with that group to get them back on track.

- **Important:** Students need to come out of today's working session with a clickable wireframe prototype so that they can iterate to high fidelity. Students must set up a time to workshop with at least two of the instructional staff.

  - There is a time slot for user flow review. Students need to check in throughout the work session.

  - Set up and Slack out the [Check-in review](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vjm_8BNEoxJIz1RAYGtpPVf8gafrAWbxEjMHeitWe9Q) so students can sign up for review. You can also write it on the whiteboard.

- **Remember:** You and the TAs should not be standing around or sitting at your computers. Engage with students throughout the entire day.

- Implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.

  - In these workshops, student groups rotate among you and the TAs for help on specific tasks. Each workshop should last between 10 to 20 minutes. They're intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the TimeTracker: [13-15-Group-Project-2/04-Time Trackers/14.1-Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLQf8M5Y3MUV41xHP_zeMcu-NJsbt214KLNg2DXOh5Y/edit?usp=sharing).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Today's Objectives (5 min)

Welcome students to class and open the slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/14.1 Project 2, Day 4 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TUdAIKKuab6IuEIhKmS5msgRXcDr_8HNwBxcDalnoWA/edit?usp=sharing).

### Review today's objectives.
- Quickly review todays goals before diving back into group work.

## 2. Student Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up (10 min)

### Standup

Instructions:

1. Divide the class evenly among the instructional staff.

2. Each group should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should note which groups are behind. Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

- > :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Option 1:  Quickly get groups into Zoom break out rooms and with the TAs quickly join team their standups. Option 2: (less interaction) Have all teams issue their stand up in Group Slack channels using the template. Yesterday: ()Today: Blocker: (). Insturtor and TAs look out for blockers or students on the same page.

## 3. Instructor Do: Review (2 min)

Call the class back to attention.

## 4. Instructor Do: Review Requirements (3 min)

### Review Group Project 2's requirements for Week 2.

TAs, share the requirements document again:

- [Group Project 2: UI Recquirements Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iSziofQczIYeMnffiqct51tfXv6Ew3f3fapIA2kDjkQ)

## 5. Student Do: Working Session 1 (50 min)

Students should begin working on a user flow for their application.

> **Instructor Note:** Use the group signup or work with teams that need the most help first.

### Remind students:

- First, write out the steps in the user flow based on user scenarios.
- Then, build a user flow diagram.

## 6. Instructor Do: Checkpoint Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

Just like the formal daily stand-up, make time to review user flows with students.

**Students must receive feedback on their user flow for low-fidelity prototypes from at least two members of the instructional staff by the end of the day.**

Instructions:

- Set up and Slack out the [User Flow Check-in Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vjm_8BNEoxJIz1RAYGtpPVf8gafrAWbxEjMHeitWe9Q) so students can sign up for review. Alternatively, write it on the board.

## 7. Break (15 min)

Make sure groups return from break.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Don't stop sharing your screen. If you want put up a google timer or a youtube timer video it can help get students back into the zoom room on time.

## 8. Student Do: Working Session 2: UI Prototyping (50 min)

Students should continue sketching screens for each step in their UI user flow.

Students should begin working on a clickable prototype using the InVision application or the Prototyping on Paper (POP) application. (This is called the Marvel application on Android devices.)

## 9. Student Do: Peer Review (30 min)

Groups are hard at work but can share their progress and test their prototypes on other groups. Feedback should not just come from you and the TAs.

## 10. Instructor Do: Working Session 2 Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.

- Have students share a completed deliverable in Slack.

- As a reviewer, provide constructive feedback using the following format:

- I think this is compelling because ... (note one to two things you like).
- I think you could improve ... (note one to two things you think could be improved).

## 11. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)
