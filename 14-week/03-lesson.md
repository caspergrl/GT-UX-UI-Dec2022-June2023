# 14.3 Lesson Plan: Group Project 2, Day 6

---

## Overview

Today, students will work on Group Project 2, continuing the prototyping and testing cycle on their user interface (UI) solution, which should be in a high-fidelity position.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Practice a daily stand-up.
2. Make iterations to their UI prototypes.
3. Create polished high-fidelity UI prototypes.
4. Iterate UI prototypes in InVision or Adobe XD.
5. Conduct more UI usability testing.

## Class at a Glance

- Today is a working session for students. Be sure to conduct a stand-up, to workshop with student groups throughout the class, and to help students if they get stuck.

- **Important:** By the end of the day, students should complete most of the day's objectives and have a UI solution that is robust and polished.

## Preparing for Class

- Review lecture slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/14.3 Group Project 2, Day 6 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13ZiQBH32u2tQkI4LoUYXCzkhOKUS5JmCkR46hg-QX3A/edit?usp=sharing).


- **Remember:** You and the TAs should not be standing around or sitting at your computers. Engage with students throughout the entire day.

- Conduct more workshops for adding UI polish and iterations.

  - In these workshops, student groups rotate among you and the TAs for help on specific tasks. Each workshop should last between 10 to 20 minutes. They're intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

  - This approach works best if you can move students from the main classroom to small spaces to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [13-15-Group-Project-2/03-Time Trackers/14.3-Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sMh1T3lBJ72fYQVIQGSL3qpNKEC6Nqx9dMHOyPAtxUU/edit?usp=sharing).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Today's Objectives (5 min)

Welcome students to class and open the slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/14.3 Group Project 2, Day 6 slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13ZiQBH32u2tQkI4LoUYXCzkhOKUS5JmCkR46hg-QX3A/edit?usp=sharing).

### Review today's requirements
Quickly review today goals before jumping into group work.

## 2. Student Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up (10 min)

### Standup

Instructions:

**Use the same groups as the last class.**

1. Divide the class evenly among the instructional staff.
2. Each group member should answer the following questions:
   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should note which groups are behind. Assign a TA to the workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Get groups into Zoom break out rooms quickly and if teams want to do standups via Slack allow what works for their team. Instructor and TA forcing students in an online environment to actually stand during standup could allow be a quick engagement tactic.

## 3. Instructor Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up Review (5 min)

Instructional staff should help any teams with blockers.

## 4. Student Do: Working Session 1: High-Fidelity UI Prototyping (55 min)

Students should start implementing iterations from their user tests as they create digital wireframes in Figma/Adobe XD.

**Optional: Students can create wireframes using the iOS or material design frameworks.**

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Instructor and TAs should move between group breakout rooms use Slack to communicate with groups. We recommend using more scheduling with groups to make sure the instructional staff is not too disruptive to the groups working flow. Don't allow groups to not touch base online collaboration is harder and will require more accountability.

## 5. Instructor Do: Working Session 1: High-Fidelity UI Prototyping Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.

- Have students share a completed deliverable in Slack.

- As a reviewer, provide constructive feedback using the following format:
    - I think this is compelling because ... (note one to two things you like).
    - I think you could improve ... (note one to two things you think could be improved).

## 6. Break (15 min)

Encourage students to use their break to conduct some guerrilla UI testing.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Don't stop sharing your screen. If you want put up a google timer or a youtube timer video it can help get students back into the zoom room on time.

## 7. Student Do: Working Session 2: High-Fidelity UI Prototype Testing (50 min)

Students should continue working on their prototypes and start testing an updated high-fidelity prototype in InVision and/or Adobe XD and/or Figma.

## 8. Student Do: Usability Testing Round 2 (30 min)

If students complete their prototypes in class, encourage them to begin another round of user testing.

## 9. Instructor Do: Working Session 2: High-Fidelity UI Prototype Testing Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.

- Have students share a completed deliverable in Slack.

- As a reviewer, provide constructive feedback using the following format:
  - I think this is compelling because ... (note one to two things you like).
  - I think you could improve...(note one to two things you think could be improved).
