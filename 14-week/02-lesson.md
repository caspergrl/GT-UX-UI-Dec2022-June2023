## Overview

Today, students will continue working on Group Project 2. They will work on user interface (UI) prototyping, UI usability testing, and UI iterations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Practice a daily stand-up.
2. Build a clickable prototype in InVision or Adobe XD.
3. Write a usability testing plan.
4. Conduct at least three user tests.
5. Analyze usability testing data.

## Class at a Glance

- Today is a working session for students focusing on usability testing and UI iteration. Be sure to conduct a stand-up, to workshop with student groups throughout the class, and to help students if they get stuck.

- **Important:** By the end of the day, students should have conducted user testing on their UI prototypes.

## Preparing for Class

- Review the lecture slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/14.2 Group Project 2, Day 5 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YA21gtZZK70PyGev1Ra5-2FSkkhY-oj6KPUSDSeEAZw/edit?usp=sharing).

- If a group falls behind schedule, assign a teaching assistant (TA) to actively workshop with that group to get it back on track.

- **Remember:** You and the TAs should not be standing around or sitting at your computers. Engage with students throughout the entire day.

- Workshops with individual groups should focus on usability testing and UI prototype iterations.

  - In these workshops, student groups rotate among you and the TAs for help on specific tasks. Each workshop should last between 10 to 20 minutes. They're intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

  - This approach works best for usability testing if you can move students from the main classroom to small spaces to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

2. Each group member should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should note which groups are behind. Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Get groups into Zoom break out rooms quickly and if teams want to do standups via Slack allow what works for their team. Instructor and TA forcing students in an online environment to actually stand during standup could allow be a quick engagement tactic.

## 3. Instructor Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up Review (5 min)

Instructional staff should help any teams with blockers.

## 4. Student Do: Working Session 1: InVision or Adobe XD Prototype (55 min)

Students should continue building their UI prototypes using InVision or Adobe XD prototype.

- > :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: The instructional staff will rotate checking in with the teams in their breakout rooms. Review progress, answer questions, and provide guidance while they're working.

## 5. Instructor Do: Review (10 min)

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.

- Have students share a completed deliverable in Slack.

  - I think you could improve ... (note one to two things you think could be improved).

## 6. Break (15 min)

Make sure groups return from the break.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Don't stop sharing your screen. If you want put up a google timer or a youtube timer video it can help get students back into the zoom room on time.
