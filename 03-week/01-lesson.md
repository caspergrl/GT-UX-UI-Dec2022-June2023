# 3.1: UX User Flows

## Overview

Last week, students studied the design thinking process's ideation phase tools, including practicing with user insights, feature prioritization, and storyboards.

Today's focus is user flows. We'll cover user flow analysis, user flowcharts, and user flows for onboarding.

As a whole, Unit 3 prepares students to contribute basic prototyping skills to future design teams. Specifically, how to make user flow diagrams, sketch wireframes, and create clickable digital prototypes in Figma and InVision.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Perform a user flow analysis on a website.

2. Construct a user flow for making a sandwich.

3. Build a user flow based on an imaginary car insurance app.

## Class at a Glance

Today, we'll focus on user flows, and you'll help students learn the following tools:

- User flow analysis
- Flowchart building and user onboarding
- User flows

Each topic includes a lecture, an activity, and an activity review.

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Instructor Notes

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to reduce review time, or choose not to send students into Zoom breakout rooms.

## Preparing for Class

- **Review today's slides beforehand.**

Read through the slides: [03-week/01-Slides/03.1-User Flows Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12VbvckkSvOroiiGA0qzhaiwMnbTIRTH8C-hjZuEbjcY/edit?usp=sharing).

Make any teaching notes you'll need.

As you review this lesson plan, jot down professional anecdotes to share. This will support the value of tools and concepts you'll be teaching and get students excited about real-world jobs in design. Look for the :gem: icon throughout this lesson plan for when to share.

- **Familiarize yourself with the activity instructions.**


> **Instructor Note:** Don't worry, SSMs will reimburse you for the costs of purchasing bagel sandwich supplies—**keep your receipts!**

Prepare yourself to be able to quickly summarize the activities during class, which will help students dive in productively.

There's no need to read the instructions word for word, but do summarize the key steps.  

- **Think about how to make the user flow activity kinetic.**

Today, students will do a user flow activity to describe the steps to make a sandwich.

You'll need bagel sandwich-making supplies for today's class. See the Class Materials section below for your shopping list. Due to allergies, we encourage the use of bagels and cream cheese. 

- **User flows are a tough concept for students to grasp.**

Use the last review of the day for you and your instructional team to provide *every student* with feedback on their user flows.

- **Familiarize yourself with the homework.**

You'll need to emphasize how important it is for students to keep up with their homework.

The weekly homework is built with class lessons in mind—each week teaches them what they need to know to complete the homework. Doing the homework is how students get the deep learning they need by putting into practice all of the in-class material they're absorbing.

At the end of class, be sure to place a strong emphasis on keeping up with the homework. Remind students that they'll get more out of each and every class if they keep pace with the lessons and their homework.

## Class Materials
:globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: When the bagel-sandwich-making activity is done in the classroom, students make the sandwiches. However, online you will be the one making sandwiches.

Don't worry, student support managers (SSMs) will reimburse you for the costs of purchasing bagel sandwich supplies—keep your receipts! Coordinate with the Cohort SSM as they will help provide some classroom materials.

Bagel sandwich shopping list:
- A package of bagels (6)
- One package of cream cheese
- One jar of jam or jelly
- A butter knife
- Napkins
- A plate or just a preparation surface

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Objectives (3 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** This short lecture aims to give students a sense of what a task flow analysis is and then throw them into the task flow analysis activity that follows. 

Welcome the students to Unit 3.

- Open and download today's slides. TAs should share them with the students via Slack: [03-week/01-Slides/03.1-User Flows Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12VbvckkSvOroiiGA0qzhaiwMnbTIRTH8C-hjZuEbjcY/edit?usp=sharing).

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Engage class and get everyone energized. [Instruction Tips](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/ux-ui-curriculum-version2/tree/master/01-lesson-plans/0-Instruction-Tips).

- Today is all about user flows, which map and graphically communicate how a user moves through and interacts with a product.

**Prime students' minds for today's content.**

- Draw from students' own lives to help them get into a relevant frame of mind for studying user flows. For example, **ask students**:
- *Have you ever visualized a sports game on paper or sketched out the plays for a game?*
- *Have you ever written out a sequence of steps for someone (maybe in a training situation)?*
- *Have you ever seen a sign that says, "Use Other Door?"*
- These are all examples of types of user flows, so without realizing it, you already have knowledge that you can draw on to understand today's concepts.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students can post answers in Slack or raise their hands to speak. Keep things interactive!

**Connect today's learning to UX/UI careers.**
- Share how user flows have had value in your own career or UX/UI designers in general.
- Provide a couple of examples that support the assertion that all UX/UI designers apply user flows in their jobs on design teams, for example:
    - While real-world designers might not apply *every* single user flow tool you're learning, they do *always* apply user flow tools on *every* UX/UI project. No design project succeeds if the user flow hasn't been studied and documented.

**Tools reveal users.**

No other tools or processes reveal the users' steps to achieving their goals like these do. Unfortunately, some product managers and designers believe they are *more* knowledgeable about a user's process than the user. This mistake in thinking can lead them to skip this step as if this research isn’t necessary. As you know, how we *think* people do things and how they *actually* do them are often quite different.

- As students progress through this lesson and execute the activities, that difference should become clear to everyone.

- **TAs,** Slack out [iPhone Sketching Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oiQAsaaS4jKxyZoCl7AlgHAk-Pa7PGCG).
  - The template is for tomorrow, when we'll sketch wireframes. Everyone should print out the template in advance.

**Walk through today's learning objectives.**

Remind students they are only three weeks in, and we are starting to get into a grove.

- Connect today's learning to the **Ideate Phase** of the design thinknig process. 
  - In this phase we generate ideas in great numbers. 

**Resurface the idea that design thinking is multidirectional, not linear.**

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this short lecture is to give students a sense of what a task flow analysis is and then throw them into the task flow analysis activity that follows. You want them to struggle a bit, as it brings them closer to the user's own experience. This lecture supports today's first learning objective, which is to perform a task flow analysis on a website.

- Continue to remind students that the design thinking process is not linear, and that as professional UX designers, they'll move around and repeat phases as they work on a design. For learning purposes, however, we'll study it linearly.

## 2. Instructor Do: User Flow Analysis (5 min)

### What Is a User Flow?

A user flow diagram shows how users travel through an application or process while performing a specific task.

Examples of a user flow:

- The steps a user takes to sign up for an online newsletter.
  - Tasks might include going to homepage > locating the newsletter signup form > entering their email > clicking Sign Up > confirming email sign up.

- The flow of tasks from selecting a product to purchasing it (checkout).
  - _Ask class what some of the steps may be_

## SLIDE 8
### What Is a User Flow?
A user flow is the path a user follows through a process or application to complete a task. 

### When Do Designers Make User Flow?

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Real-world designers create user flows during the design process's ideate phase. This helps them communicate the path a user will take through a product's pages or actions.

The best time to create a user flow is between the ideate and prototype phases of the design thinking process. That means *before* you build products. This will ensure that you have a solid foundation to build on, and you don't design yourself into a corner (e.g., missing buttons or impossible-to-navigate menus).

*When should we create user flows?*
- Before building a new product or feature
- After we have created storyboards and a customer /or/ user journey map.
- Before we create wireframes and prototypes.

- **TAs,** Slack out: [The Biggest WTF in Design](https://uxdesign.cc/the-biggest-wtf-in-design-right-now-87139f367d66)

### Why Do Designers Create User Flows?

As we discussed, user flows communicate a user's intended flow through various pages and actions in an app or website. And we design user flows in order to improve the user’s experience. So understanding user flows and how users interact with them is what allows you to improve the UX.


## SLIDE 9
### What Is User Flow Analysis?

User flow analysis is a step-by-step analysis of how users travel through part of an app or website while performing a specific task through observation.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Real-world designers perform a user flow analysis when conducting user research or during the discovery phase of onboarding a new product. This helps expose friction in the user journey and allows the designers to empathize with the product's users.

### Why Perform a User Flow Analysis?

The goal of a user flow analysis is to identify potential problems and hypothesize what could solve the problem. For example, how do you add a product to a cart or how do you check out?

A user flow analysis helps designers study the sequences of steps in an app or site. User flow design is never left to chance: designers reworking task flows repeatedly iterate in response to the issues that they observed during testing and analysis.

### User Flow Analysis Is a Useful Tool

- A process of learning how users travel through part of an app or website while performing a specific task through observation.

- It helps you understand users’ goals and what they are trying to achieve by visually defining the user's steps and questions.

- It helps us determine which user flow tasks are performed similarly by all users, and which tasks cause users common problems with the task flow logic.

- A user flow does not have to encompass an entire app, but rather just a task, and the screens relevant to that task.

## 3. Student Do: User Flow Analysis Activity (20 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to allow students to feel a bit of discomfort, like a user navigating a site for the first time.

**TAs,** Slack out the activity file to students:
- [03-Week/02-Activities/03.1-01 User Analysis Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OYeUXS7FUyPtk8YOEy3kmjWkTsGpXLVOy9jj-U9DOI0/edit?usp=sharing)

Also, Slack out the template they'll be using in Part 1:
[03-Week/02-Activities/03.1-01 User Flow Analysis Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qfKUbYUmxdiKayL_HrxhpjolDbYwkuC0lECb6NfQSUM)

**Summary**

Students are going to conduct a user flow analysis of the checkout tasks for cabelas.com and identify any pain points in the task flow.

**Instructions**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms of student pairs as you describe the following activity. Follow these instructions to pre-assign breakout rooms for this and future activities.

- Broadcast a two-minute warning to breakout rooms to help them wrap up this activity.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Be sure to check your #ClassActivities Slack channel for questions while students are in breakout rooms. Also, make sure you and the TAs jump in and out of breakout rooms to address questions and provide feedback.

The activity has three parts:
1. Students should use the User Flow Analysis Template, a Google spreadsheet. (2 min)
2. They'll navigate to the cabelas.com website and perform a task flow study. Specifically, students will analyze Cabela's checkout flow. (17 min)
3. They'll work together to fill in their templates and submit them via Slack. (1 min.)

***Bonus:*** If a student team finishes early, they may analyze another feature (e.g., the login flow, creating a profile, or searching for content in the search bar).

**Instructor and TAs**

- Keep an eye on Slack for student questions or requests for help.

- Remind students that any discomfort they feel is exactly what a customer—the user—feels.

- Remind students not to skip any cell in the template.

**Look out for the following things during the activity.**

If students are:

2. Rushing through the activity

    - Instructor should ask them to review the steps. Can another student follow their path exactly? Are there any steps they missed?

**Deliverable**

Students will share their user flow analysis for cabelas.com on Slack.

## SLIDE 13
## 4. Instructor Do: User Flow Analysis Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention and close out the Zoom breakout rooms.

Lead a review of the activity.

First, select a student's work from Slack and invite them to present it.

**Questions that you and the TAs can ask:

- How did the Cabela's checkout experience make you feel?
  - Frustrated?
  - Dumb?
  - Smart?
  - Bored?
  - Agitated?
- What did you notice about the process?
- How many steps did you have to take?
- What did you like?
- What would you change?

***Repeat this process for one to two additional students, if time allows.***

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions.

**TAs,** Slack out: [UXPA’s Usability Body of Knowledge Site](http://www.usabilitybok.org/task-analysis). It breaks down the user flow analysis steps for students to review after class.

*Provide students with actionable feedback that they can apply the next time they perform a user flow analysis.*

- Be sure to document EVERY step. This is critical to performing an accurate analysis.
- You WILL miss steps when performing a user flow analysis for a complicated workflow. User flow analysis helps designers identify gaps in knowledge.

*Wrap up by sharing some common FAQs or misconceptions about user flow analysis:*

- You can perform a user flow analysis with sticky notes as well (allows you to move tasks around easily).
- You can use a user flow analysis late in a project to identify opportunities for new UI elements and features.
- All members of your team can benefit from a user flow analysis (from design to development).

Now that students have a general understanding of a user flow analysis, they can learn about user flow—that's next!

### Benefits of User Flows

User flows:

- Help designers reflect on the flow, communicate it with the team and stakeholders, and get feedback.

- Let designers compare alternatives, as well as evaluate and test them with real users before proceeding.

- Make it easier, wiser, and cheaper to make changes on this level by preventing costly changes later on.

### What Questions Must User Flows Address?

*User flows are concerned with three key ideas:*

1. Who is the user?
2. What is their goal?
3. What are the steps the user needs to take to achieve that goal?


### What Do User Flows Look Like?

A user flow helps designers visualize the path a user takes to complete a task while using a website, app, or any product.

User flows can have a combination of three key elements:

1. Task flows (requirements)
2. Wireflows (low fidelity)
3. Screen flows (high fidelity)

*When designing user flows, consider the following questions:*

- What is the user trying to accomplish?

- What is essential to the user, and what will give them the confidence to continue?

- What additional information will the user need to accomplish the task?

- What are the user’s hesitations or barriers to accomplishing the task?

### User Flow Design Process

4 Steps When Iterating Low-High Fidelity Flows:

- This flow is showing two sets of iteration... the structure of the flow and the fidelity. The structure of the flow is the more common iteration with flows. High Fidelity tends to be used more in prototypes than in user flows.

- You would begin your work by defining a user goal or story.

- Then create a user task flow and flowchart.

- Then create wireframes and build a wireflow.

- Expand the flow to include details such as if/then scenarios and decisions. 

## SLIDE 23
**Step 1. Define the User Goal** - "As a shopper, I want to cash out my earnings instantly, right after my work shift."

- Let’s first consider the persona of the shopper who brings Instacart patrons their groceries.

- What is the shopper’s goal? To cash out their money immediately after work.

## SLIDE 24
**Step 2. Write the User Task Flow** - "*How would the user access the feature? Where does the feature live?"*

- List out all the steps a user takes to complete a specific task.

## SLIDE 25
- Review the example.

## SLIDE 26
**Step 3. Build the Wireflow**

- For each step in the task flow, we would create a wireframe that corresponds to the step in the flow.

## SLIDE 27
- A **wireflow** is a user flow created using wireframes.


## SLIDE 28
**Step 4. Final User Flow**

- After defining the user/task flows, we create wireframes and a flowchart.

- This will show the user's steps on an interaction level.

- If we deconstruct the UI, we see a defined user flow for even this small task.

- Then we can see how each part of the user flow matches up to items on the screens.

*The process for designing user flows:*

- Choose a critical path.
- Define entry points.
- Identify user end goals.
- Identify success metrics (e.g., time to completion, number of clicks).
- Define the steps the user will take in between.

### User Flow Diagram: Three Tips

Designers may appear to just sit at their screens moving things around, but if you look closely, you'll see them applying three steps to their user flow process: think deeply, note interactions, and diagram left to right.

1. Think deeply.
Think through every step a user will take to interact with your product. Each part of a user flow will be turned into a wireframe.

2. Note interactions.
Add notes to your connectors explaining the interactions taking place between screens.

3. Diagram like you read, left to right and top to bottom.
In the west, we read left to right, so work to make your user flow consumable in that format.

## 6. Student Do: Sandwich User Flowchart Activity (35 min)

**TAs,** share the activity file with students via Slack: [03-Week/02-Activities/03.1-02-PBJ-Flow-Chart Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-u85lWKDHZ-xhJCizQjsFnFcOiHBTck35ZDxnZpEoM/edit?usp=sharing).

Instructor and TAs: Circulate around the Zoom breakout rooms, help students move through the activity without distraction, and help those who get stuck.

**Summary**

The goal of this activity is to use flowchart symbols and descriptions to explain how to make a bagel or peanut butter and jelly (PB&J) sandwich.

**Instructions**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms with groups of four to five students as you describe the following activity. Follow these instructions to pre-assign breakout rooms for this and future activities.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Be sure to check your #ClassActivities Slack channel for questions while students are in breakout rooms. Also, make sure you and the TAs jump in and out of breakout rooms to address questions and provide feedback.

- Broadcast a two-minute warning to breakout rooms to help them wrap up this activity.

> **Instructor Note:** Request that groups to share their Miro boards with you, as you can open them and have a "god view" to watch activity progress. If a team seems lagging in Miro, jump into their breakout room to help them.

The activity has four parts:
1. A student lead will set up each team's Miro board and share it with each member and the instructors and TAs. (5 min)
2. Students will write the instructions: each and every step and procedure for making a sandwich, either PB&J or cream cheese and jelly bagel sandwich. (15 min)
3. They'll add the flowchart symbols to their chart. (15 min)
4. They'll share their flowchart on Slack.

**Instructor and TAs**

- Set a timer for 15 minutes for each of the two main parts of the activity.
- Remind the groups to carefully follow the activity instructions and capture *every single one* of the steps involved in making a sandwich, whether it's a bagel or a PB&J sandwich.
- Students will struggle with this activity. That's okay. Remind them that you will be building a sandwich from their user flows, and encourage them to iterate and walk through their sequences again.

**Look for the following things during the activity.**

If students are:

1. Rushing through the activity

    - Instructor should ask them to review the steps. Can another student follow their path exactly? Are there any steps they missed?

**Deliverable**

Students will generate a flowchart (using the flowchart symbols) that explains how to make a simple PB&J or bagel sandwich.

## SLIDE 52
## 7. Instructor Do: Sandwich User Flowchart Activity Review (20 min)

Close out the Zoom breakout rooms and draw everyone's attention back to your screen.

**Make Bagel Sandwiches**

You should be prepared with bagel-making supplies.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Arrange your screen so that students can see the bagel you're making as you execute their user flowcharts.

1. Start by asking a student group to read their instructions.
2. Make the sandwich as they describe the steps to take.

> **Instructor Note:** **Aim to make a sandwich from the flowcharts of 2-3 groups.**

**Review the Activity**

- Ask each group to reflect on how the activity went.
- Ask them to discuss what they learned, would have done differently, and did well.
- Invite the class to share feedback on what went well or could be improved.

**Review Students' Flowcharts**

Ask students to take photos of their flowcharts and share them in Slack.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Review two or three student flowcharts and provide feedback.
  - Invite the TAs to provide feedback.
  - Invite students to provide feedback on their classmates' work.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a time that you realized how difficult it was to write what seemed like straightforward instructions, and how that experience helps you in your current work. Connect this lesson back to the importance of getting into a user's shoes.

*Share tips that students can apply the next time they create a user flow:*

- Use a name that describes your diagram's purpose. This will help anyone who sees it to understand its purpose.
- Use one direction when drawing the flowchart. Flows are easier to read and understand when the map flows in one direction.
- Only cover a single user task in your flow to reduce complexity.
- Use a digital tool to speed up your process and to quickly gather feedback.

*Wrap up by sharing some common FAQs or misconceptions about user flows:*

- If you remember one thing about user flows, it’s to define them by the goal your user achieves by completing the flow.
- It is really difficult to create wireframes and prototypes without user flows and even more difficult to iterate the designs.

Next, after the break, students are going to take things one step further and map out the onboarding flow for an app. This will give them another opportunity to use flowchart diagram symbols, but with a higher level of complexity.

- Users have no time to waste. They’ll quit if it takes too much effort to get what they want. The average app loses 77% of its daily active users within the first three days after the install (source: Android Authority).
- You need to activate new users. If not, you’re throwing your acquisition investments out the window.
- This is your first impression. This is what all your users will experience first. This is what they’ll tell their peers.
- From the moment a user starts with a product, you need to convey a number of things immediately: Where is the user? What can the user do within the app? Where can the user go within the app?

### What Is User Onboarding?

- Deals with the first-time UX.

- The process of increasing the likelihood that new users become successful when adopting your product.

### When and Why Do Designers Care About User Onboarding?

When: When you are designing the first-time UX. 

Why: To retain users and reduce the overall amount of churn.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how you think about onboarding when having client discussions.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Real-world designers think critically about user onboarding and first-time user experiences to drive business success. For example, designers will test the current product and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data to ideate on potential improvements. They will build prototypes and do A/B testing to assess what elements perform best and conduct competitive analysis to assess similar competitor's products.

### The Seven User Onboarding Tips

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Call on particular students to read one of the seven steps aloud. The student who reads one should "tag" the next student to read. Keep students engaged!

**Tip 1**: Emphasize your value proposition (i.e., the service or feature that makes your product stand out as valuable to consumers).

- "Here's what our product can do" and "here's what you can do with our product" sound similar but are completely different approaches!

## SLIDE 61
**Tip 2**: Highlight core features.

- You don’t need to throw in the kitchen sink when onboarding—just define a few of the most important features.

## SLIDE 62
**Tip 3**: Ask only for what is needed.

- Studies show that 60% of users say they have chosen not to install an app after discovering how much personal information the app asked for.

  - **TAs,** Slack out the link: [Why people don't install apps](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/259655-quarter-of-all-android-apps-ask-for-gps-data).

## SLIDE 63
**Tip 4**: Make it snappy.

- Avoid text-heavy explanations.
- Opt instead for app screenshots and illustrations to get your point across.

## SLIDE 64
**Tip 5**: End with a call to action (CTA).

- Don’t forget to include a call-to-action at the end of your onboarding experience so that users have a direct next step to take.

## SLIDE 65
**Tip 6**: Use coaching screens.

- Coach screens convey value and features to users.
- Typically, coaching screens show up for first-time users and can be accessed or turned off in the preferences.

## SLIDE 66
**Tip 7**: Create interactive tutorials.

- Interactive onboarding follows the “show rather than tell” method of app onboarding.

## SLIDE 67
### The Design Mindset for User Onboarding

From the moment a user starts with a product, you need to convey a number of things to them immediately:

- Where am I? Let the user know where they are and leave them in no doubt that they are at the starting point of their explorations.

- What can I do? Let the user know, within reason, the things they can do within the product.

- Where can I go? Once you have conveyed their current location and some of the things the user is able to do, you must make it apparent to them where they can go next.

### Registration Best Practices and Tips

The login/sign-up step is a big hurdle the user has to cross to enjoy the services you're offering. A bad login/sign-up journey leads to large drop-offs and poor experience. Some of the best examples of this process come from world-class software products like Google search or Amazon.

## SLIDE 71
- **Tip 1**: Use social logins to make the sign-up easy.

  - When possible, always give users the option to sign onto your app through existing social media accounts like Facebook, Twitter, or Google.

## SLIDE 72
- **Tip 2**: Follow Instagram's example.

  - Instagram does sign-up really well:

- They tell us why we should sign up.
  - Remind users what they’re getting out of filling out all these input fields. No one wants to do this. Tell them why it’s worth it.
- They have a Social Login button.
  - Your users have a barrier to entry. Make that barrier as small as possible—the lowest number of fields.
  - Just ask Expedia, which cut one form field and gained $12 million.

- **TAs,** Slack out: [https://www.zdnet.com/article/expedia-on-how-one-extra-data-field-can-cost-12m/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expedia-on-how-one-extra-data-field-can-cost-12m/).

  - They ask for only basic information (other information can be obtained AFTER sign-up).
  - They use one column of input fields with labels above the fields, not on the left.
    - Avoid two input fields side-by-side. Users should seamlessly read and enter info from top to bottom, not left to right to top to bottom. Remember: The simpler the flow, the faster it feels.


## SLIDE 73
- **Tip 3**: Group similar fields together.

- Every required field should be clearly marked. It doesn’t really help to use * to indicate a required field. A better choice is marking fields (optional).


## SLIDE 74
- **Tip 4**: Errors should:

1. Be detected and revealed to the user as they leave that field, not after the submit button is clicked. This stems from an eye-tracking usability test completed by the Baymard Institute, which concluded that “to perfect the user’s recovery experience, live inline validation must be used.”

2. Have a clear error message that is visually pronounced, brief, and tells the user how to fix the problem. Don’t tell the user they did something wrong. It’s Alex Birkett’s first of many great rules on error messages. Instead, tell users how to fix the problem.

Reddit does a good job of this. Users don’t want a lengthy input session only to get hit with a rejection at the end of it. The rules above turn that stop sign into a speed bump.

## 10. Student Do: Task and User Flows for Onboarding Activity (40 min)

**TAs,** Slack out the activity file to students: [03-Week/02-Activities/03.1-03-User-Flow Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11C0xjAOzYR3anU1huss19RQ7Zw9GYZVsiEwfkg7xyb4/edit?usp=sharing).

**Summary**

This activity gives students practice imagining the steps in both a task flow and user flow. The flows are focused on the user onboarding process for a fictional car insurance app called NSURE.

Students will write out a task flow, then map out the user flow.

**Instructions**

Students will work independently in the main Zoom room during this activity.

This activity has five parts:
1. Set up a new project in Figma. (1 min)
2. Create the task flow—frame and boxes, indicating all the steps. (10 min)
3. Create a user flow diagram using all the proper elements. (15 min)
4. **Bonus step**—digitize the user flow using Figma, Miro, or FlowMapp. (12 min)
5. Wrap up and share their work via Slack. (2 min)

> **Instructor Note:** If students do not finish, it's okay! There is time during the next class to continue working on the user flow document.

**Instructor and TAs**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** This activity should be done individually so you don’t need to create breakout rooms. Instead, make sure the whole class is muted and switch to Zoom **gallery** view so you can monitor students as they work. Tell them that if they have a question, they should share it on the #ClassActivities Slack channel and a member of the instructional staff will respond. If a student has a question that is relevant to the whole class, you or one of the TAs should unmute and share your answer with everyone.

- Broadcast a two-minute warning to help them wrap up this work session.

**Look out for the following during the activity.**

If students:

1) Struggle to write out the task flow

    - Ask them to verbalize step by step what they think should happen. Then tell them to write that down.

2) Finish early

    - Wait for one more student to be finished and share your user flow. The other student should ask questions to help identify gaps (if any). After taking down some notes from the share, switch!

**Deliverable**
Students should generate a task flow as well as a user flow.

- Students might struggle with this activity. If they finish early, have them review their user flows with a TA.

**Review**

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. Reassure students that there is time planned to reflect on this activity in the next class.The review of this activity will happen next class (Lesson 3.2). Take questions. Reassure students that there is time planned to reflect on this activity in the next class.

## 11. Instructor Do: Recap, Assign Challenge, and End Class (5 min)

At this point, students have learned everything essential to fulfilling today’s learning objectives and preparing them to work on their weekly challenge.

### Today's Key Takeaways

- What students learned today will help them as real-world designers who can contribute to their future design teams.
- The tools they practiced are invaluable for uncovering a user's actual process for interacting with a design.
- Students now see that designers and product managers are *not* more knowledgeable about a user's process than the user.
- Observing and listening to users creates successful designs.

### Review Today's Concepts

Spend a couple of minutes helping students anchor today’s learning through mental recall.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Ask students to raise their hands—or post answers in Slack—and offer definitions for the following concepts, all learned today in class:

- How do you show someone how to make a sandwich? (Answer: user flow)
- What is a user flow analysis? (Answer: It helps designers identify potential problems and hypothesize what could solve the problem.)

> **Say:**  "Now that you have some practice with these UX skills, you can get started on your challenge for this week. You'll learn more skills throughout the week, but remember not to procrastinate."

**Challenge**

Introduce and read through the challenge instructions for the week.

**TAs,** Slack out the weekly challenge instructions: [03-week/04-Homework/01-Instructions/03-Unit Homework Instructions: Prototyping Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZX_ZoWDh995z1YsSd-JllS2ROoOM1ZkR8-c8nXSoiZg/edit?usp=sharing).

Remind everyone about your after-class office hours.

> **Say:** "If anyone has questions about the challenge, now is a great time to ask!"

Wish everyone a good night.
