# 3.2 Competitor Analysis, User Flows, and Wireframes

---

## Overview

Last class, students learned about user flows and onboarding. Today will begin with a discussion of heuristics and the role that competitor analysis plays in the discovery process of design thinking. Then we'll return to ideation and students will continue working on their user flows. Students will also learn about wireframes and practice sketching them.

As a whole, Unit 3 focuses on the *prototyping phase* and prepares students to create user flow diagrams, wireframes, and clickable digital prototypes in Figma and InVision. This enables them to contribute basic prototyping skills to future design teams.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Define usability heuristics and identify examples of heuristic techniques used in apps and sites.

2. Conduct a competitor analysis for your onboarding user flow.

3. Complete user flows diagrams.

4. Sketch paper wireframes for a mobile app.

## Class at a Glance

There is a lot to cover today, so watch the time. Class may run 5-10 minutes over schedule.

Today's lesson can be divided into three key topics:

1. Usability heuristics
2. Competitor analysis
3. Wireframing

> **Instructor Note:** Mid-lesson, students will iterate the onboarding activity from the last class.

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Instructor Notes
Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

## Preparing for Class

- Review your slides: [03-Week/03-Slides/03.2-Competitor Analysis, User Flows and Wireframes Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JfZ4pjaMP_pPxRPlhX3vZzownrtS4LNrCko046KfOrQ/edit?usp=sharing).
  - :bulb: The slides and lesson plan work together: the slides are a visual expression of the lesson plan; the lesson plan contains detail to support the slides.
- Make any teaching notes you'll need for your lectures. 
- Come up with anecdotes to share during class. Relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future careers.
  - Look for this icon in the lesson plan :gem: for opportunities to share your professional experience. 
- **IMPORTANT: User flows continued:**

Last class, students started designing a user flow for a fictional mobile app startup called NSURE. Today, students will have some time to wrap up that activity. Students will build on this user flow by designing wireframes for it. 

> **Instructor Note:** While you are free to do the review at the start of class, the Time Tracker suggests you do the review *after* you discuss competitive research. We'll leave that up to you.

- **Emphasize the value of the challenge and keeping up with it:**

The weekly challenge is designed with class lessons in mind—each week teaches them what they need to know to complete the challenge. Doing the challenge is how students get the deep learning they need by putting into practice all of the in-class material they're absorbing.

At the end of class, place a strong emphasis on keeping up with the challenge. Remind students that they'll get more out of each class if they keep pace with the lessons and their challenge.

## Class Materials

Watch a sample video of this class being taught by Peter Pillsbury at University of California, Irvine.

## Office Hours (45 min before class)

Encourage students to join the Zoom classroom early, use the time provided, and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who show up early and participate in office hours.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Objectives (2 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to welcome students to class and get them in the right mind frame for today's learning.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Start the class out with an engagement tactic. Reference the [Instruction Tips](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/ux-ui-curriculum-version2/tree/master/01-lesson-plans/0-Instruction-Tips).

Your slides: [03-week/01-Slides/03.2-Competitor Analysis, User Flows and Wireframes Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JfZ4pjaMP_pPxRPlhX3vZzownrtS4LNrCko046KfOrQ/edit?usp=sharing).

- Begin by welcoming students to class.

- Today is all about user flows and wireframes and the *prototyping phase* of the design thinking process.

**Energize students with some interaction**

> **Instructor Note:** Invite students to post responses to Slack or raise their hands to respond.

  - Ask a couple of students to share the experience they had creating user flows.
  - Ask if students have any lingering confusion around user flows.

- **How we're building on students' existing knowledge:**

  - Today, students will build on their user flow diagrams from the previous class by designing wireframes, enabling them to practice solving interface problems, work through visualizing their user flows, and design low-fidelity prototypes for future user testing. 

> **Ask:** "When have you illustrated a plan of sequenced action?" 

  - For example, if they have drawn a map/driving directions for a friend to navigate, an illustrated itinerary for a fun weekend, a floor plan for a new apartment, or even a treasure map as a kid! 

**Connect Today's Learning to UX/UI Careers**

Creating user flows and wireframes are key skills for UX/UI designers, which they regularly use on the job. For example, UX/UI designers use these skills when they work on product features like check-out features, search features, or UI forms.

- Conducting competitor analysis and using usability heuristics are also tools designers require in their toolbelt to be effective at work. For example, UX/UI designers are expected to be experts in the trends and best practices of UX/UI as well as what is being used by their business's competitors.

- Walk through today's learning objectives. 

## 2. Instructor Do: 10 Usability Heuristics (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal for this section is to help students understand why heuristic principles are at the heart of creating good wireframes, reviewing competitors' products, and usability testing. This lecture addresses today's first learning objective, which is for students to define usability heuristics and identify examples of heuristic techniques used in apps and sites.

Start by defining usability and providing examples. Then move on to define and give examples of heuristics. Finally, walk through the 10 usability heuristics.

## SLIDE 5
- As designers, our goal is to build products that are easy to use. Share UX author Steve Krug's quote: "Usability really just means making sure that something works well: that a person of average ability and experience can use the thing—whether it’s a website, a toaster, or a revolving door—for its intended purpose without getting hopelessly frustrated."

Steve Krug is a UX designer and is best known for his book *Don't Make Me Think* about human-computer interaction and web usability.

## SLIDE 6

"Usability" refers to how easy it is to use a product, or not, and what makes it so. 

- Usability assesses how easy UIs are to use. Usability also refers to methods for improving ease of use during the design process. Overall, five quality components define usability:

- **Learnability** asks how easy it is for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design.
- **Efficiency** asks once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
- **Memorability** asks when users return to the design after an interval, how easily can they re-establish proficiency?
- **Errors** measure how many errors users make, how severe these errors are, and how easily they can recover from the errors?
- **Satisfaction** assesses how pleasant it is to use the design.

### The 10 Common Usability Heuristics

Usability heuristics from Jakob Nielsen:

**1. Visibility of a system status:**
  - Here, we see users informed of status with a progress bar.
  - Here, we see users informed of status with the color red emphasizing departure time.


## SLIDE 11
**2. Match between the system and the real world:** Here, we see a digital credit card form match up with a physical credit card interface.


## SLIDE 12
**3. User control and freedom:** Here, we see how you can undo an email sent to the trash in Gmail.


## SLIDE 13
**4. Consistency and standards:** Here, we see two buttons that do the same thing but have different colors. We want to avoid this.


## SLIDE 14
**5. Error prevention:** Here, we see a password strength meter, which is common when you create a new account, especially a new password.


## SLIDE 15
**6. Recognition rather than recall:** Here, we see how Bing lets you browse your search history to revisit recent searches you might have forgotten.

## SLIDE 16
**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Here, we see Microsoft Outlook hide the Advanced Settings so the majority of users can focus on signing up.

## SLIDE 17
**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Here, we see how Google has stripped away all unnecessary elements to perform a search. There is only a textbox.

## SLIDE 18
**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and fix errors:** Here, we see a sign-up form with a helpful error message.

## SLIDE 19
**10. Help and documentation:** Here, we see available documentation, which is particularly useful for complex, technical products.

### How Do Designers Learn About and Evaluate Products?

Every designer works for a company that wants to make money and stay in business. In the United States, we have a free market with open competition. Businesses seek a competitive advantage to outperform competitors.

In today's tech-dependent world, design and UX are a competitive advantage. Usability heuristics is just one of many tools designers have to evaluate products. So how do designers learn if their competitors' products are better or worse than their own? How do designers learn about the competitive advantages in the UX world? Designers perform a competitor analysis.

### Competitor Analysis
For anyone starting to design a new product, it is critical to make sure it has a good market fit. The product also has to have a compelling competitive advantage over others in the marketplace. So how do you evaluate the competitive edge? By running an effective competitor analysis.

Competitor analysis is the research and identification of competitors and their strengths and weaknesses relative to those of your own product or service. Most designers use a spreadsheet of some kind to organize their data about competitors, which they then analyze in order to draw insights from the information.

Real-world designers continuously evaluate what the competition is doing. If they don't know what features a competitive product has, they could release something that already exists. But if they know what competitors are doing, they can make a unique product. Competitive analysis should be present in your portfolios and as skill on your resume and LinkedIn skills profile. 

### Why and When to Perform Competitor Analysis

- To find **inspiration** in other people’s success

- To find **opportunities** in other people’s design faults

***Why***

- Designers perform competitor analysis to discover how to solve a user problem in a unique way.

- After identifying a problem that they can develop into a business opportunity, designers research what products or services their target customers currently use to solve the same problem. Some questions they might ask:

- *Is there an equivalent product or service out there?* 
 - *Is there an alternative solution people are using that’s good enough but not perfect?* 
   	- For example, people use their backpacks or book bags to carry their lunch to work so do they really need a special lunch tote product? 

***When***

- Competitor analysis is part of the research designers do during the design thinking process. Competitor analysis is typically done concurrently with the empathy, definition, and ideation phases. 

- Working on competitor analysis early ensures that the problems designers define and the solutions they ideate and prototype are not already on the market. If competitors have addressed the problem, have they done it effectively, or is there an opportunity to do it better?

## SLIDE 34
### Two Main Types of Competition

Most products have three to five key competitors. It's important to analyze what competitors are doing well and what they are not doing well. Analyzing competition increases your chances of developing a unique and competitive product.  

- *Direct competition:* Businesses are competing for the same potential market. For example, consider Uber versus Lyft.

- *Indirect competition:* Conflict between vendors whose products or services are not the same, but that could satisfy the same consumer need. For example, consider Uber versus driving one's own car and who makes that car (car manufacturers).

### How to Perform a Competitor Analysis

Imagine we work on a UX team that is designing a car insurance quote app. In our design thinking process, we have just narrowed down and prioritized our ideas and features. It's the perfect time to evaluate the competition.

- First, identify competitors.
  - Identify both *direct* and *indirect* competitors.


## SLIDE 41
- Second, take screenshots as we analyze competing products.
  - Evaluate and annotate things they do well and poorly using the plus/delta model or the feature inventory method.

## SLIDE 42
- Finally, we turn our notes into a detailed deliverable (i.e., a competitive grid).

**Summary**

Students will conduct a competitor analysis for our client, NSURE. Their report will focus on how NSURE's competitors onboard customers.

To do this, students will search for competitors of NSURE online. They will identify four competitors in total (two *direct* and two *indirect*), critique their strengths and weaknesses, and fill in the competitor analysis grid.

> **Note about competitors:** Two should be direct competitors and two should be indirect competitors. Students must think critically about each competitor and find *both* strengths *and* weaknesses in their product design.

**Instructions**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Prebuild breakout rooms and assign group roles to allow the groups to hit the ground running. 

- Create breakout rooms for student groups of two to three. 
- Open the Google document and summarize the instructions for the class. 
- Students should make a copy of the Competitor Analysis Template.

**Instructor and TAs** 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation** Visit the groups in their breakout rooms throughout the activity. In addition to checking on groups, keep on top of responding to students' questions on Slack, too. 

***If students struggle in their thinking about competitors:*** Provide a concrete example of a direct and indirect competitor, then challenge them to find two more (for a total of three). 

- Direct competitors of Pepsi Cola are Coke, Fanta, Red Bull, Sprite, and Gatorade.

- Indirect competitors of Pepsi Cola are Evian or Arrowhead spring water, Vitamin Water, Tejava iced tea, or Starbucks bottled Frappuccino. 

***If students struggle to agree on whether a business is a competitor or not:*** Challenge them to identify the reasons why this is a competitor. Is a major part of their product a significant feature for their competitors’ users? 

**Deliverable**

Students will post a link to their competitor analysis grid that shows their analysis of four of NSURE's competitors in Slack. 

## SLIDE 44
## 6. Instructor Do: Competitor Analysis Activity Review (15 min)

Close the breakout rooms and attract everyone's attention back to your screen. 

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students elect a team lead and prepare for you to spotlight them on Zoom to present their team's work. Other students can post feedback on Slack.

Start by selecting a competitive analysis grid from Slack and opening it. 

Next, have the group leader walk the class through their team's competitor analysis.

- **Ask the student:**
  - *What is one thing you like about this?*
  - *What is one thing you would do differently?*
  - *What surprised you about this process?*
  - *How might this process influence your feature prioritization?*

***Review two to four additional competitor analysis grids if time allows and repeat the feedback steps.***

Once the presentations are over, ask the class how the activity went using the prompts below. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation** Invite students to raise their hands and speak or use Slack to post their answers. Keep an eye on Slack and discuss the interesting comments that others could benefit from.

- *What made it [difficult, easy, etc.]?*

- *What did you learn?* 
- *Is anything still confusing for you?* 

Next, provide students with a couple of tips that they can apply the next time they create a competitor analysis:

- Look at your competition very analytically because they may be doing something, even if it's very simple, much better than everyone else. 
- You must be able to find inspiration anywhere and everywhere; it's a skill designers hone over time. 
- Look at what's new *as well as what's old.* Don't forget to ask, "What established products in the marketplace are doing well?" 

Finally, wrap up by sharing some common FAQs or misconceptions about competitor analysis:

- Competitor analysis is not a replacement for user research; it's complementary. For example, being able to align an unmet user need and a gap in competition is where UX shines and can be innovative when inventing new features or solving unaddressed user and business needs. The overlap of business needs and user needs requires a lot of user research and a lot of business analysis.

- Ask: "How many of you want to go work for start-ups? If you can't create value for your users, your business will fail." 

> **Instructor Note:** Take any final questions and then move on to your lecture about iteration.


## SLIDE 45
Review

## SLIDE 46
Iteration among designers and stakeholders is the main tool we have to improve a solution. 

- "Iteration" is the revision process, often on an ongoing basis, informed by feedback from users, a design team, testing, and stakeholders. 

- Through iterations, designers understand, explore, and validate their assumptions, with the ability to always go back and forth through this process until the assumption achieves a lower risk of failure.

- The importance of seeing the design process from this approach addresses the need to improve our capabilities to explore, validate, and improve our solutions effectively. Imagine a design solution as a car passing through an assembly line in a factory, and every iteration is like an assembly station where we shape the solution a bit more every time until the final product has fewer possibilities to fail when it’s confronted with the user’s context.

### Validating Assumptions

This is the phase where solutions are reviewed to validate our assumptions. It's not just about asking for feedback. The real goal should be to confront the possible solutions resulting from the previous phase, with simulated realities. If the previous phase was about making questions, this is the phase where these questions find answers in the form of inputs.

We'll return to the concept of validating assumptions later in the boot camp when we dive into user testing. For today, let's train our focus on user flows, wireframes, and prototypes. 

For now, here's what you should know about validating assumptions: do not assume that because you are a UX/UI designer you know better. Yes, we care a lot about solving and improving a user's experience. However, our users will be the judge, jury, and sometimes executioner. **Remember: YOU ARE NOT THE USER!**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will work independently, so keep everyone in the main Zoom room and have everyone share their screen. 

**First, connect competitive analysis to iteration.** 

Say: "Now that we've looked at some examples for user onboarding, let's use that knowledge as we work to finalize our user flows from last class. You may have come up with ideas since last class that you can now use as you make iterations to your user flow."

**Next, have students iterate their user flows.**
Students will continue working on their user flows from the previous class for the user onboarding process for a fictional car insurance app called NSURE.

> **Instructor Note:** If all students have finished their work from the previous class, push forward into the review portion of lecture.

**Finally, have students submit their deliverable:**
Students should generate a task flow as well as a user flow in Figma. Have them share their deliverables on Slack. 

## SLIDE 48
## 9. Instructor Do: User Flow Onboarding Activity Review (15 min)

Call everyone's attention back to a review. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** If any students are not finished, have a TA offer help in a breakout room or via Slack.

**Lead a critique of the students' work.**

1. Select one student at a time and ask them to present their work to the class.
2. Depending on time, give each student a chance to present their work.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Engage the whole class by asking questions and inviting student participation via Slack as well as speaking via Zoom: 

- How clear is the path the user takes to reach his or her goal?
- What are the ways the user could reach the goal more easily?
- What are the potential issues with this flow?
- Could anything make this flow clearer for the user?

**Engage students in a discussion of the activity itself:**

- How comfortable was everyone with creating a user flow? 
- Was there anything they wish they did differently when creating the flows for the first time?
- What do you believe could happen if steps are skipped? Some responses could be:
    - Users may get stuck at some point in a process.
    - Essential steps for users may be missed.
    - Users may get stressed about the task at hand and give up.
    - Designers and developers won’t be able to include all the necessary elements on your site or application. 

***Provide students with a couple of tips that they can apply the next time they make user flows*:** 

Students should now understand how user flow differs from the task flow. User flows include a higher level of detail. A user flow is what a designer uses to pinpoint what elements are needed on a site or app—for example, a “Back” vs. “Cancel” button.

***Wrap up by sharing some common FAQs or misconceptions about user flows*:** 

- A user flow is more complicated than a task flow, as there are more details to consider. For example: a user flow should map all the interactions and decisions both your user and your system need to take to get your user from point A to point B in your user interface. 
- In user flows, you may even want to include information about reversing decisions and duplicating actions. For example, not all paths are linear and your user should be able to jump around an experience. 

> **Instructor Note:** Pause to see if there are any questions from the class. If there's time, ask TAs to share some final thoughts on the review or user flow in general. User flows are hard, so if students are struggling, encourage them to come to office hours or request a creative coaching session through their SSM.

## SLIDE 49
## 10. Break (10 min)

Brain breaks are critical to learning, so encourage students to get up from their laptops at home.
Everyone should get some fresh air, stretch, or have some food.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Don't stop sharing your screen. Instead, put up a Google or YouTube timer video on your screen. This type of visual reminder helps students return to their laptops on time.

Let students know that you'll be discussing wireframes after the break.

## SLIDE 51
### Wireframes Overview

Wireframes are a visual way for designers to translate user flows into a very basic design of an app or site experience. Designers start the wireframing process with sketching on paper and then iterate from there into a digital wireframe.

### How Wireframes Communicate

Wireframes are a way for designers to communicate to developers how they intend the product, such as a website or mobile application, to be laid out.

- Are used to define the information hierarchy of your design.
- Make it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information.
- Wireframes are blueprints for screens. They are representations of what the UI will look like.
- Increase the speed of iterations.
- Improve communication across the product team.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Designers who communicate visually with ease are an asset to design teams. Real-world designers use wireframes to visually communicate product features to stakeholders. Why? Wireframes focus attention on the usability factor. Plus, a wireframe is easy to revise or iterate. 

## SLIDE 52
### Wireframes Are Like an Architect's Blueprint

A very common analogy is to compare wireframes to blueprints. We have a blueprint of a house that describes how the house should be laid out on the left. On the right, we have a wireframe for a website that shows how the designer wants the website to be laid out.

- Wireframes exist so that you can focus on the structure of the design. Similarly, blueprints don't specify implementation details, such as the counter material or the color of the walls.

## SLIDE 53
### Wireframes Focus on Usability and Structure

A common misconception is that you need to have a lot of aesthetic details in a wireframe, but one key part about them is that they emphasize usability. 
This means you won't really see things like color-specific fonts or any of the bells and whistles that you think are really important.

- Wireframes can get bad rap for being simplistic. "Oh, you UX designers just draw boxes and call it a day?!" However, your low-fidelity executions should have high levels of quality, including annotations, context, and clear system rules included to make a wireframe a useful UX/UI deliverable. 

## SLIDE 54
### Wireframes Are Made After Sketching, and Wireframes Are Needed Before Creating Mockups

Wireframes focus on usability because they're created before mockups in the design process. After they're created and approved, the designers will go back and fill them in to create more mature mockup designs or more specific design sketches of what the application should look like.

## SLIDE 55
### Wireframes Are Reviewed by the Team

Once wireframes are created, there are discussions between the designers and the team to make sure that the wireframes address the business needs and that the proposals are feasible. From there, the designers will create more formal mockups to pass off to the developers to build.

### Developers Use Wireframes

Developers can use the wireframes to break the design down into pieces and translate those pieces into a development plan for their sprint.


Wireframes can be broken down into basic building blocks and pieces. These are how developers will build each element on the page. As we get deeper into the course, we will talk about design systems and creating design components that make work easier for the developers who build our designs. It is very common and expected when creating wireframes to add annotations that explain the elements' functionality on the page.

## SLIDE 58
### The Wireframe Process Is Different for Every Organization

Every organization will have a different wireframe process based on resources and time constraints. Some organizations might skip sketching and go straight into wireframes. Some organizations might go straight into creating mockups—don't do that! Overall, this is the process that every organization would ideally follow for creating mockups. They would create user flows, sketches, basic wireframes, and mockups. From there, an interaction designer would build a prototype.

### Why Do We Need Wireframes?

- Wireframes connect the site’s information architecture to its visual design by showing paths between pages.
- They determine intended functionality in the interface.
- They help developers understand what to build.

### Wireframe Tips

**Tip 1: Before sketching a wireframe, make a list.**

  - Don't just start sketching; you will waste time. Make a plan and list out every element your interface requires.

  - There are millions of possibilities of how to sketch a wireframe, but if you start by defining the elements, you can then determine how those elements can be visualized in a wireframe.

## SLIDE 62
**Tip 2: Use a grid.**
- Use a grid to help establish logic and structure. 

- We recommend using mobile sketching templates or create your own by tracing your smartphone. 

- **TAs,** slack out sketching templates: [https://sneakpeekit.com/](https://sneakpeekit.com/)

  - There are others as well. Share if you have them.

## SLIDE 63
**Tip 3: Use drawing tools.**

- Not all of us are skilled at drawing. Some of us have shaky hands, are not that practiced, or don’t feel confident sketching complicated shapes. 
That is why there are drawing tools to speed things up!
- Rulers
- French curves
- UI sketching templates

## SLIDE 64
**Tip 4: Sketch one-to-one.**

Trace your phone if you must but drawing wireframes at the actual physical size will help when designing UIs that are sized correctly.

- Remember, the physical size and the pixel size are not the same, especially with retina screen and high-resolution monitors. 

## SLIDES 65-66
**Tip 5: Take advantage of UI controls.**

Learning UI controls and UI design patterns are essential to speeding up your wireframing process.

- UI controls are the building blocks of any software interface. Using them intelligently can make wireframes feel familiar and learnable. Becoming familiar with them as a UI designer is essential for a good UX.

## 12. Student Do: Paper Wireframe Activity Parts 1-2 (35 min)

**TAs,** slack out the activity files to students:

[03-Week/03-Activities/03.2-03-Paper-Wireframes Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FjVY7Sq5tcFKqkAmCcNyQMxoCsxiBHuYYYTGK7GvNgU/edit)

> **Instructor Note:** This activity file includes instructions for parts 1-5 of the activity, which together comprise sections 12-14 of this LP.

**Summary**

This activity builds on the user flow activities. Students will sketch wireframes for a mobile app. These sketches will be used to create a clickable paper prototype during the next class.

> **Instructor Note:** Just because students are online does not mean they should only be using digital tools to execute solutions. Encourage the use of paper/pencil at home. Students can hold their sketches up to the Zoom camera for help or to share.

**Instructions**

- Keep students in the main Zoom room, as they will work independently until Part 3.
- Open the Google document and summarize the instructions for the class. 
- The activity has five parts:
  - Part 1 (Section 12): Students will gather paper and pens and trace three to five outlines of their mobile phones. (5 min) 
  - Part 2 (Section 12): Students will draw wireframes according to the user flows they created and with reference to the list of requirements provided in the instructions document. (30 min)
  - Part 3 (Section 13): Conduct peer reviews in groups of two. (10 min)
    
    - > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation** ***Create breakout rooms of two students for this peer reviews.***
  - Part 4 (Section 14): Students will upload photos of their wireframes in preparation for the next class. (4 min)
  - Part 5 (Section 14): Students will wrap up and share photos of their work in Slack. (1 min)

**Instructor and TAs:** 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation** Move from screen to screen to see how students are progressing and offer support, particularly during the 30 minutes of sketching wireframes. 

***If students struggle with their sketching:*** Let students know that wireframes are about expressing ideas, much like creating storyboards, and that their sketches do not need to be high fidelity. 

**Deliverable**

Students will sketch wireframes based on the provided requirements document and share their work in Slack.

## 13. Student Do: Paper Wireframe Activity Part 3 - Peer Review (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation** Have students remain in their groups of two in breakout rooms for this peer review.

**Summary** 

Here, students will give their partner feedback on their wireframes. Partners should use the design critique approach for their conversations: *what I like* and *what could be improved*. 

**Instructions**

1. Have students remain in their groups of two in breakout rooms (pairs).

2. Have students share their work with their partner, then take turns walking their partner through the wireframes. 

3. At the five-minute mark, remind students to switch roles.

**Instructor and TAs** 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** With your TAs, cycle through the Zoom rooms to observe and support students in their peer reviews.

- Make note of students who are doing a good job and those who are struggling with wireframing.

**Deliverable:** 

Students will make notes based on the feedback they receive from their partner, but it's optional to share their notes in Slack. 

## 14. Student Do: Paper Wireframe Activity Parts 4-5 (5 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students remain in their groups of two in the breakout rooms.

**Summary** 
Here, students will complete parts 4 and 5 of the activity:

  - Part 4: Students will upload photos of their wireframes in preparation for the next class. (4 min)
  - Part 5: Students will wrap up and share photos of their work in Slack. (1 min)

**End the Activity**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** *For students who struggle to wrap up the activity in time:* Send a TA to help them, whether over Slack or by creating a new breakout room.

## 15. Instructor Do: Paper Wireframe Activity Review (10 min)

Close out the breakout rooms and call everyone's attention back to your screen on Zoom.

***Remind students to post their sketched wireframe images to Slack for this review.*** 

Here, you will lead a review and critique of student work. 

> **Say:** "Not every designer is a visual designer, but being able to communicate your flows visually is very important. Pairing your flows with wireframes gets your teammates on the same page and provides a shared understanding."

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Leverage Slack to be sure that the TAs, yourself, and all students have an opportunity to share feedback. Encourage hand-raising and speaking aloud on Zoom. 

**Lead a review of students' wireframes.**

- Questions to stimulate class discussion:

  - *Is there a clear direction of where the user should navigate? Is there an effective call to action?*

  - *Does it establish a visual hierarchy?*

- Questions to ask students of their work:
  - *What elements did they notice were similar in their wireframes vs. those of other students?*
  - *What was different?*
  - *What did you learn?*

***Aim to review about 40% of the students' wireframes or whatever time allows.***

Next, provide students with a couple of tips that they can apply the next time they create wireframes:

- In paper prototyping, not all steps in the user flow will require a separate screen, but you may want to include feedback the user will see after completing an action. 

- Be sure to take photos of your wireframes *in each state* to make it easier to create, update, and duplicate screens.

Finally, wrap up by sharing some common FAQs or misconceptions about wireframes:

- Pairing your user flows with wireframes helps get your teammates on the same page and provides a shared understanding.

- Wireframes are not arbitrary; they are part of a UX logic. By including a user flow with a wireframe, you will help your audience follow along easier.

> **Instructor Note:** Take any lingering questions before ending class.
>
> - Remind students that they can stay online for office hours.

## 16. Instructor Do: Recap (2 min)

Spend a couple of minutes helping students anchor today’s learning. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students raise their hands—or post answers in Slack—and offer definitions for the following concepts:

1. What are heuristics, and why are they valuable to UX/UI design teams?
2. What are the parts of a competitor analysis (for a user flow)?
3. What is the value of a wireframe, and what makes one good?

> **Instructor Note:** Field any final questions. If there are complex questions, invite students to stay online for office hours.

Next class, the instructional staff will take challenge questions and conduct a challenge critique. 

- Remind everyone about your office hours, which are after class.

- Wish everyone a good night.
