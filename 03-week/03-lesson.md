# 3.3 Lesson Plan: Low-Fidelity Prototyping

---

## Overview

Today's class will continue to build on prototyping skills. Students will build a clickable prototype in InVision, conduct an ad-hoc usability test, and iterate their paper prototypes as they practice creating digital wireframes in Figma.

In the last class, students learned about user flows and how to notice and document the many steps a user takes in a sequence of actions. That foundation will help students pivot to *visualizing* a basic design of an app that will embody user flow.

Students will leave today's class with stronger prototyping skills and a deeper understanding of the purpose of digital wireframes and clickable prototypes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Build a clickable prototype using InVision.

2. Identify UI design patterns on the web.

3. Create digital wireframes using Figma.

## Class at a Glance

Today's class covers the prototyping phase of the design thinking process. It is divided into two parts:

- In Part 1, students will build a clickable prototype in InVision using their paper wireframes, share it with peers, and critique peers constructively.
- In Part 2, you'll cover UI design patterns and the best practices for wireframing. You'll demo how to build wireframes in Figma and students will work independently to build wireframes for their user flows.
- **Today's lesson includes two demos:** A 10-minute demo of InVision prototyping in Section 3 and a demo of Figma in Section 10.

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).


## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: > :globe_with_meridians:) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians:**Online class:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

## Preparing for Class

- **Read through your materials carefully:** the entire lesson plan, slides, student activity files, and the Time Tracker. Make notes so that you are thoroughly prepared to teach and support students.
- Your slides: [03-Week/01-Slides/03.3Lo-Fi Prototyping Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UsXicrwK3fPqNuN6F4rkT2GLNOaA-Q9J2V7FhaHaZdI/edit?usp=sharing).
- **Do a practice run-through of your demos:** 
  - You'll give a demo of wireframing with InVision in Section 3 of the lesson.
  - You'll be demoing how to create a wireframe in Figma in Section 10.  
- **Prepare for a fast-moving class:** We've given you a lot of material to cover today. Prepare for how you'll cover everything, stay on track, and complete the lesson in the time allotted.  
- **Prepare a challenge reminder:** At the end of class, you'll be reminding students that they'll need to have a clickable InVision prototype ready for the next class. Why? Because the next class (Unit 4) will move into usability testing.
  - **Support students in keeping up with challenge:** At the end of class, be sure to place a strong emphasis on keeping up with the weekly challenges. Remind students that they'll get more out of each and every class if they keep pace with the lessons and their challenge.
- **Prepare for student struggles with Figma or InVision:** Be prepared to notice which students are getting it and which are struggling. Lean on your TAs to help students who get stuck. Remind students to lean on their peers as a resource. 
- **Familiarize yourself with the activity instructions: **Students will readily dive into the activities if you provide verbal guidance. There's no need to read the instructions word for word during class, but do summarize the key steps.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Low-Fidelity Prototypes (2 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to introduce today's learning objectives and provide a quick introduction to low-fidelity prototypes. 

- Open and download today's slides. TAs should share them with the students via Slack: [03-Week/01-Slides/03.3-Lo-Fi Prototyping Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UsXicrwK3fPqNuN6F4rkT2GLNOaA-Q9J2V7FhaHaZdI/edit?usp=sharing).

***Note to instructor:*** You're covering a lot of material, so today's welcome lecture is shorter than normal. 

**Walk through today's learning objectives.**

Introduce the concept of low-fidelity prototypes.

- There are two types of low-fidelity prototypes: *paper prototypes* and *clickable wireframes*.

- A *paper prototype* is a model of a solution using cheap materials (paper). Paper prototypes are rapid executions of an idea or UI solution executed in the fastest, cheapest method available.

- A *clickable wireframe* is an iteration of a paper prototype that builds a UI with limited iterations using a prototyping software (InVision, Figma, Adobe XD, etc.). All have tools for adding clickable "hotspots" that allow a user to click through a UX. 

- These two types of low-fidelity prototypes enable designers to gather valuable user input on their designs without building an entire app. They are helpful to designers in three ways: 
   1. They show key elements and functionality of an app, rather than the app coded in its entirety. 

   2. They show particular aspects of UI elements (buttons, navigation, UI features, etc.) and enable designers to get feedback and iterate on UI features without having to build out every single screen or design every UI element. 

   3. They are useful for testing concepts and creating multiple solutions, as they should be faster to produce.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how you've used paper prototypes and clickable wireframes in your projects. 

**Compare low-fidelity prototypes to high-fidelity prototypes.**

- By comparison, high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes are very close to the final design itself. A high-fidelity prototype is nearly finished and includes:
   - All the app's screens, interfaces, graphics, and often coding. 
- High-fidelity prototypes are part of the prototyping life cycle and all designers use them, but they aren't our focus today.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Invite engagement by having students raise their hands and respond or use Slack to answer the following question: 

> **Ask:** "Does anyone remember the two types of low-fidelity prototypes?"


- *Answer*: Paper prototypes and clickable wireframes.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions before moving on. 

**TAs,** slack out the following Adobe blog post about the differences between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for students to review after class:
[https://theblog.adobe.com/prototyping-difference-low-fidelity-high-fidelity-prototypes-use/](https://theblog.adobe.com/prototyping-difference-low-fidelity-high-fidelity-prototypes-use/).

## 2. Instructor Do: Prototyping and Testing 101 (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** This section aims to educate students about the importance of prototyping and testing in design. This lecture supports today's first learning objective, which is for students to build a clickable prototype using InVision. 

First, you'll define prototyping and explain its usefulness. Then you'll introduce testing and its role in the design process.

- You'll follow this lecture with a demo of prototyping with InVision, then invite students to build their own prototypes.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Inspire students to engage and respond to the following question over Zoom or Slack: ***"What is your best guess at a definition of prototyping?"***

### Prototyping 101

Prototypes are a rough version of a finished product. They are used to show how the final product will look and work. Prototypes enable designers to experience how the application flows as well as test the usability and feasibility of the designs. Prototypes can be any fidelity you need: low or high fidelity.

- Prototyping involves producing an early, inexpensive, and scaled-down version of the product to reveal any current design problems.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Real-world designers create prototypes for many purposes: to communicate a concept to key stakeholders, evaluate and test the design, identify usability issues, and identify the cost with the technology team.

### Why Designers Need Prototypes?

One of the best ways to gain insights into the design thinking process is to carry out prototyping. Prototyping allows us to determine whether the process that led us to an idea in the first place is valid. 

The following two cases require a prototype:

1. Ensure the design concept works as intended. In most cases, it’s relatively easy to test a concept with real users. Once an interactive version of a product idea is in real users' hands, a product team can see how a target audience wants to use the product. Based on this feedback, it's possible to adjust an initial concept.

2. Determine if people are able to use a product. Prototyping is essential for finding and resolving usability issues before launch. Testing reveals areas that need improvement. That’s why so many product teams create prototypes, have users test them, and iterate the design until it’s good enough.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Challenge students to respond to the following question over Zoom or Slack: ***"What might be some advantages for prototyping a design?"***

Advantages of prototyping:

- To save money, designers create simple versions of their products.

- It is an ideal way to test ideas and get feedback from users and stakeholders.

- Prototypes offer an additional level of interactivity over wireframes.

- They can be used as the foundation of product development.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Have a TA briefly share an experience of building or testing a prototype at work.

### Prototypes Have Various Levels of Fidelity

Prototypes don’t necessarily look like final products—they can have different levels of fidelity. The fidelity of a prototype refers to how it conveys the look and feel of the final product. Fidelity can vary in the areas of visual design, content, and interactivity. There are many types of prototypes, ranging anywhere between the two extremes of low to high fidelity.

- Product teams choose a prototype’s fidelity based on the goals of prototyping, completeness of design, and available resources.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Ask students to respond to the following question over Zoom or Slack: ***"Who remembers the definitions of low-fidelity prototypes vs. high-fidelity?"***

- *Low fidelity(lo-fi)*: Low fidelity means the prototypes are quite basic and don't offer too much in terms of visual design or how a user can interact with them. They're used mostly to check and test functionality rather than the visual appearance of the product. Low-fidelity prototypes can be paper prototypes or clickable wireframes.

- *High fidelity (hi-fi):* High fidelity means the prototypes are more detailed, focusing more on the interactions and look and feel of the product and giving users and testers a more involved experience. This might involve multiple features so you feel as if you're using an app. 

  - Teams usually create high-fidelity prototypes when they have a solid understanding of what they're going to build and need to either test it with real users or secure final design approval from stakeholders. High-fidelity prototypes can be created using a digital tool or using code.

### What Do Interaction Designers Do?

There might be a UX researcher, an information architect, an interaction designer, and a visual designer in a large design team. But for smaller companies and teams, most of the UX design jobs might be performed by one to two people, who might be called interaction designers.

If you really like designing and design strategy, you'll want to pursue the interaction designer path.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** If a TA has experience with interaction design, invite them to share a work anecdote.

Most interaction designers focus on the following:

- Design strategy: This is concerned with what the user's goals are and, in turn, what interactions are necessary to achieve these goals.

- Prototyping: Sometimes, interaction designers might create interactive prototypes and/or high-fidelity prototypes that look exactly like the actual app or website.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Add your own story about yours or a colleague's work as an interaction designer, if time allows.

### Testing 101

- Review the quote by Steve Krug, information architect and author of *Don’t Make Me Think*.

### Usability Testing

We create prototypes so we can test them! Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users.

- Typically, participants will try to complete typical tasks during a test while observers watch, listen, and take notes.

- The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data, and determine the participants' satisfaction with the product.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Real-world designers conduct usability tests to learn about their product. What do they learn? A lot: whether the product meets the user’s expectations, allows designers to see how successful users are with their tasks, and to catch flaws in the product. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how you've used usability testing to understand how well it met a user's expectations. 

**Your Goal: Get the Participants to Think Aloud**
Tell your students that today they'll build and test a clickable prototype. The testing will be very informal. Students will share their prototypes with a partner who will click through and verbalize their experience. Therefore, it is important to encourage your participants to verbalize their experience.

> **Say:** "We'll do a deep dive on usability testing next week. For today it will be more ad hoc."

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions.

- **TAs,** share these links for students to explore after class:

Now it's time to demo how to create a clickable prototype in InVision. 

## 3. Instructor Do: Demo - InVision Prototype (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to generate excitement about how to build a clickable prototype in InVision. 

**TA**: Set a 10-minute timer and give the instructor a two-minute warning.

**Instructor:** Don't worry if you run out of time, just demo what you can. 

> **Say:** "Pay attention because you'll be building prototypes very soon! And you'll be testing them in our next class!" 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Share your screen for the demo. Students can post questions on Slack and TAs can respond.  

**Demo Instructions**

Once you have completed your demo, let students know how excited you are that they'll be bringing their prototypes to life.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions on using InVision. 

Reassure them that they're ready to start building clickable prototypes—that's next!

## 4. Student Do: Paper Prototype and Testing Activity (40 min)

**TAs,** slack out the link to the paper prototype and test activity: [03-Week/02-Activities/03.3-01-Clickable-Paper-Prototype-and-Testing Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15v6vqOX6u1YG3jYzxud60v6Wzis2TjEf8Cq-cA8ch6U/edit#)  

Also, slack out the following video tutorials:

- [How to Create Your First Project in InVision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpTNy-hu3pg&list=PLeWHfyz6lrQXHKy01OlALt3xZRZCPi89V)

- [How to Create Interactive Prototype in InVision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H7Ql9hmbuM)

### Summary

Students will use their paper wireframe sketches from the previous class to build a clickable prototype and conduct one user test with a partner.

### Instructions

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Prebuild Zoom breakout rooms and place students in pairs. Leave one group in the main room to preserve the Zoom video for the class. 


First, students will follow the activity instructions and take photos of their wireframe sketches and import them into InVision. 

From there, they'll create their clickable prototypes.

Finally, students will gather into pairs to test their prototypes with a partner. 

### Instructors and TAs

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** During the activity, split up with the TAs to visit each of the breakout rooms. Students might need help troubleshooting with InVision. Make sure students have cropped their images before uploading them to InVision.


Be on the lookout for students who need extra assistance using InVision. Also, look out for students who are not uploading screens correctly. Some students will upload screens one at a time; help them be more efficient by placing all their screens in a folder. Also, have them label their screens with numbers. 01-home-login.png, 01.1-home-login-success.png... etc. vs. cb305481-3c49-4a59-a2ed-8c5b26832649.JPG, 
cdbb380a-1e0a-444a-a994-7e33893c5b22.JPG... etc.) InVision will use the image title. 

> **Instructor Note:** Be prepared to repeat parts of your demo to address student questions that come up during this activity. TAs will help guide students as well. 

### Deliverable

Students will post to Slack: a prototype with clickable elements created with InVision.

## 5. Instructor Do: Paper Prototype and Testing Activity Review (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Close the breakout rooms and bring attention back to your screen in the main Zoom room. TAs should assist students who are struggling to wrap up.

> **Say:** "Now that you've connected your wireframes in InVision, you can create even more screens—or additional elements to add more realistic interactivity. That's the fun of iterating." 

### Run a critique.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Aim to review 2-3 students' prototypes, if time allows. Spotlight the student in Zoom as they share their work. 

- Choose a prototype from Slack to review and open it. 
- For each student prototype you select, ask the student:

  - *Tell us, how did it work out?*
  - *Tell us something that you learned.*

- Invite the TAs to share their perspectives as well.

> **Instructor Note:** Take any questions and then give everyone a break. 

> **Say:** "If you need more practice with creating clickable prototypes, stay online after class or make time on your own." 

Next, it's time for a break. After break, you'll be discussing UI design patterns.  

## 6. Break (10 min)

Brain breaks are an important component of learning. Encourage all students to step away from their laptops: get some fresh air, stretch, or have some food.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Don't stop sharing your screen. Instead, put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual timer will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

Let students know that after the break you'll be discussing UI design patterns, which help designers solve problems and create stronger wireframes. 

## 7. Instructor Do: UI Design Patterns (8 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to define and show examples of UI design patterns. Sharing these models will train students to identify these patterns on webpages. This lecture supports today's second learning objective, which is for students to identify user interface (UI) design patterns on the web.

Today you'll return to wireframes and talk about the UI design patterns used by real-world designers. This knowledge will help students create stronger wireframes aligned with standard industry practices.

### What Is a UI Design pattern?

A UI design pattern is a reusable solution that designers employ to solve problems. All designers use UI patterns and they're considered a best practice. Why? Because using established solutions saves time while also solving common design problems.

Using UI patterns means that, as designers, we don't have to reinvent the wheel. They allow UX designers to leverage the human tendency to seek patterns everywhere, even on the web.

- They change constantly, so we need to keep up with these trends and patterns.

- They have evolved to cover many aspects of design. Let’s take a look at some of those patterns.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share an example of a UI design pattern and how you apply them in your work. 

### The UI Design Pattern Formula

UI design patterns can’t be plugged directly into an interface. Designers tailor patterns to fit a particular scenario or feature requirement.

Design patterns that emerge answer the following questions:
1. What does the user want to do?
2. When should the pattern be used?
3. What is the solution?
4. Where and how has the pattern been implemented before?

### Types of UI Patterns

1. Input patterns:

   - Users learn patterns by being exposed to them repeatedly.

   - Think about the ubiquitous search bar or even the dreaded hamburger menu.

   - We know what they do and don’t have to give it a second thought. It’s intuitive and frictionless.

2. Navigation patterns:

   - No matter which phase you are in, patterns speed up the design process. That can mean fewer headaches when it’s crunch time.

   - For example, let's look at Instagram and the infinite scroll pattern.

   - It is a great pattern for retaining user attention because there is less distracting navigation.

   - Infinite scroll is a handy UI pattern when there is a lot of content to present, as in social media sites or search results.

3. Information patterns:

   - Information patterns exist to organize content.

### What Makes a Good UI?

A good UI has:

- Clear design hierarchy

- Information clearly organized for importance and understandability

**Review the example of good UI.**

- The core principles of UI design are clarity, flexibility, familiarity, efficiency, and consistency.

- Of these, clarity is the No. 1 objective.

- Clarity in UI design empowers users to have positive interactions and easily find the information they're seeking.

### UI Pattern Analysis

Let's analyze a wireframe together to identify some UI patterns.

On this wireframe, we can see a few basic patterns:

- **Navigation bar**: It is the first element on the page when designing top-down.

- **Box**: Usually, it represents an image or video. A box should represent the aspect ratio of images and videos.

- **Copy placeholder**: It provides copy for context.

- **UI elements and interaction state**: Represent UI features and state of the interface, including open and closed lists, the active state of tabs, and areas of user selection.

- **Structure containers and content chunking**: Wireframes establish underlying structure and content hierarchy.

Show the slide with YouTube's homepage. 

Ask, "**What design patterns do you notice on YouTube**?"

Review the UI pattern analysis for YouTube.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** The ability of professional designers to identify user interface (UI) design patterns on the web brings great value to their teams.

Now that students have learned about UI design patterns and viewed common examples, it's time for them to practice identifying UI design patterns.

## 8. Student Do: UI Design Patterns Activity (12 min)

**TAs,** slack out the link to the UI design patterns activity: 

- [03-Week/02-Activities/03.3/03.3-02-UI-Design-Patterns](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z8uhpIK7JoQOvQGYkAJ1waeyGD_mT9McmP2EpIMN7Hc).

- [Figma 03.2-02-UI-Design-Pattern-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/oTJ3XSNVsOANMJDH2hLeE7/03.3-02-UI-Design-Pattern-Template?node-id=2%3A52)

**Summary**

In this activity, students will practice identifying UI design patterns on a webpage (Yelp.com).

**Instructions**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms of student pairs as you describe the following activity. Follow these instructions to pre-assign breakout rooms for this and future activities.

- Broadcast a two-minute warning to breakout rooms to help them wrap up this activity.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Set up students in Zoom breakout rooms in groups of two. Keep one group in the main Zoom room to preserve the class recording.

- Students will work in Figma. 

- Working in pairs, students will navigate to Yelp.com. 
- There, they'll take a screenshot of the homepage. 

- Next, they'll spend some time identifying UI design patterns on the page and making annotations.   
- Finally, they'll share their annotations on Slack. 

**Instructor and TAs**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Move between breakout screens as students work to ensure they're making progress and to offer help if needed. If they're having trouble spotting patters, help them by pulling up a UI pattern library and have students look for similar uses.

*Students might have potential struggles* with getting a good screenshot. Recommend using [Chrome Awesome Screenshot Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-screen/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj?hl=en). 

**Deliverable**

Students will create an annotated webpage posted to a Figma artboard and share it on Slack.

## 9. Instructor Do: UI Design Patterns Activity Review (8 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Close the breakout rooms and bring attention back to your screen in the main Zoom room.  


**Run a critique.**

- Scroll through Slack and choose a screenshot of a Yelp pattern analysis.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Aim to review just one pair's prototypes, two if time allows. Spotlight the student in Zoom as they share their work. Invite students to respond by speaking aloud or using Slack for comments. Be sure to monitor Slack or have a TA help with that.

***Ask the student team:***

- *What design patterns did you notice on the page?*
- *What surprised you about the patterns?*
- *Did you have any trouble identifying UI patterns?*

***Invite the TAs and class to offer feedback:***

- *Does anyone notice a UI pattern that the group missed?*
- *What else did you notice or gain insight about?*

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

Next up, you will walk through the best practices designers follow for wireframes.  

## 10. Instructor Do: Wireframes Best Practices (8 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** This section aims to walk students through wireframing best practices, which will prepare students for creating digital wireframes in Figma. This lecture supports today's third, and final, learning objective, which is for students to create digital wireframes using Figma. 

Now that students know how UI design patterns help designers add efficiency to their wireframes, it's time for them to see how wireframing best practices make a designer's life easier in the real world. 

These best practices will help students take a smarter approach to their own wireframing.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** The ability of professional designers to create digital wireframes using Figma in their work with clients enables them to effectively test their designs and iterate, improving the probability of creating successful products.

### Wireframe Quiz

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Inspire students to engage and respond to the following 3 questions over Zoom or Slack:   

1. *What are wireframes?*
2. *Why do we use wireframes in UX?*
3. *Wireframes should always use color and images.* 
   1. ***Answer:*** The answer is "false" or thumbs-down.

**Review the wireframe dos and don'ts.**

### Review Wireframe Don'ts.

1. Include various end visuals such as pictures, actual colors, and fonts.
2. Include Lorem Ipsum filler copy (use real text in the wireframe).
3. Represent the final design. 
4. Spend too much time drawing.

#### Generate additional "Don't" with the Class: 

1. Do not use color.
   - Color is powerful; it can be distracting.
   - If you must use color, use it sparingly and consistently.
   - Choose a color not in the client's palette to ensure your discussion remains focused on the experience you are creating and not the visual design.
   - Share an experience about distracting clients with color if you have one.
2. Do not add 'fancy' graphics or images.
   - Instead, try using simple rectangles and squares as placeholders with an “x” through the middle of the box to show where the image will be placed.

### Review Wireframe Dos.

Review the example of a good wireframe: A good wireframe is well labeled and easy to understand.

1. Mostly visual with some text/annotation.
2. Limited use of color.
3. Placeholder text and images.
4. Low-medium fidelity.
5. Limited interactivity.

#### Generate additional "Don't" with the Class: 

1. Do use actual content.
   - If you don’t have content, write it. Writing is a design skill; it will only help you understand the client and story better.
2. Do communicate functionalities and interactions statically.

   - Wireframing and prototyping are amazing tools, but they serve very different purposes.
   - Prototyping is more time-intensive than wireframing. Key functionalities or interactions can be easily communicated statically.
   - Ask the client what they need.
   - If user testing is an important part of the project, prototyping might get you far.
   - The key is to know when you’ve crossed over to prototyping and be deliberate about it.
3. Do set clear expectations.

   - Talk with the client about how you're using wireframing as a tool.
   - If a client’s expectations are not met, it doesn’t matter how brilliant your work is—they will not hear you.
   - The best way to proactively avoid failed expectations is to communicate them clearly, early, and often.
   - Share an experience about sharing wireframes with coworkers or a client.
4. Do practice non-attachment.

   - Don’t get too attached to your wireframes. They’re not glamorous portfolio pieces.
   - With rapid ideation, we must be willing to entertain change and pivot often.
5. Do keep it simple.

   - When we have lots of new ideas, it’s easy to try and make them all work together or confuse elements of one idea with another.
6. Do give each idea its own wireframe.

> **Instructor Note:** Take any remaining questions students may have about digital wireframes.


## 11. Instructor Do: Content Strategy and UX Writing (8 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to define UX writing and its usefulness to design teams. 

Now that students understand best practices for wireframes, it's time for them to learn how to think about the content on a page.

### What Is UX Writing?

UX writing is part of content strategy. The UX writer is responsible for all the text the user encounters when navigating around a product. If you enjoy writing, you might want to explore this career path. In this course, you'll act as your own UX writer.

- It is the practice of designing the words people see when they interact with software UIs.
- It’s about designing the conversation between a product and its user.
- UX writing is a growing field.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Real-world UX writers are responsible for all the text the user encounters when navigating around a product. This career path is ideal for designers who have a passion for writing. 

### Who Hires UX Writers?

- San Francisco companies lead the trend: Dropbox, Facebook, Airbnb, Pinterest, Google, and Spotify have UX writing, content strategy, or content design teams.

### Content Strategy

Content strategy has been around for a long time. Large corporations such as Disney, Wells Fargo, and Mayo Clinic have had functional content strategy teams for years. So why do we care about it in UX? The answer is simple: it's nearly impossible to design a great UX for bad content. If you're passionate about creating a better UX, you'll also care about delivering useful, usable, engaging content.

- ***Review the Content Strategy Helps UX Strategy Slide.***

### How Is UX Writing Different From Other Writing?

- UX writing is a specialized form of writing because of its context (software) and the environment in which it’s produced (technology companies).

### Lyft vs. UberPool UX Writing Example

- The two screens (see slide) show the same interaction from Lyft Line and UberPOOL.

  - In both, you’ve chosen a shared ride, and the service needs to know how many spots you need.

  - Lyft begins with an imperative statement, telling you what you need to do (“Confirm number of passengers”) and explains why there’s a limit.

  - Uber begins with the question: “How many seats do you need?”

- Both services give you two options to reply to.

  - Lyft lets you choose “Just Me” or “Me + 1 friend,” and shows the cost difference right there.

  - Uber gives you numbers to reply with: 1 or 2.

- This is a pretty simple interaction, and both approaches are quite clear.

- But each service sets a very different tone here.

- Lyft guides you, informs you, then offers you two very casual, friendly replies.

  - By using “Just me” and “Me + 1 friend,” they’ve planted two hints with you: (1) Lyft is for riding with friends, and (2) you can engage with the Lyft service in a casual, friendly way.

- Uber, in contrast, is extremely minimal.

  - This approach is a lot more transactional.

> **Instructor Note:** Check for questions about the Lyft vs. UberPool examples. 

- ***Share the Mailchimp example, "Mailchimp Set the Bar for UX Writing."***

### UX Writing Best Practices

- **Put users first**: focus on the user.

- **Be clear**: jargon-free, use context.
  - For example, the pen tool vs. the Bezier manipulation tool.

- **Be concise**: economical word choice.

- **Make your writing useful**: direct the user to the next action.

### UX Writing Example

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Invite students to write down their own versions of the original copy, below.  Students can share their writing on Slack. 

- **Version 1 (Original)**:
  - At first, we start with a generic mobile screen.
  - *Pay with your phone in stores and enjoy quick checkout in apps.*

- **Version 2:**
  - As we add a brand's voice, we see a personality emerge.
  - *A faster way to pay.*

- **Version 3:**
   - When we integrate the tone, we can see how a little graphic is used to visualize that.
    -  *Everything you need to speed through checkout.*

> **Instructor Note:** Check in with students: are there any questions about UX writing so far? 

Help students grasp how writing for UX and prototyping fit together to communicate with users, their teams, and stakeholders about their designs. Designers are not only communicating the organization of their design when they create a prototype but also expressing excitement as well.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Drive this point home with a brief anecdote about how you've collaborated with UX writers. 

### Walk Through Turning a User Flow Into Wireframes

***Slides note: The goal of these slides to help the student visualize how to turn a user flow into wireframes. We'll imagine we're creating an app for booking a local tour guide.***

- First, we take our user flow.

- Start with a splash screen:

  - The splash screen is an introduction page.

  - It typically has a logo and a call to action.

- Sign-up screen:

  - Starts the onboarding process for first-time users.

  - Wireframes focus on the hierarchy of information.


- Login screens (for return users) have a few essential elements:

  - Email

  - Password

  - Button

- Login screen keyboard:

  - We have to think through each step in the interaction.

  - When you fill out a form, the keyboard pops up.

  - We may even want to add social login to make it easier to use.

- Home screen:

  - We're in!

  - However, first, we have to ask users for permission to access the phone GPS.

  - Remember: You cannot access someone's data without permission.

  - The next step is to show the map.

  - Maybe we add a loading icon because our tech is buggy or slow.

  - Then we see dots on the map with text labels.

  - If we click on a label, we see a detailed modal page.

  - There is probably more.

- Filter screen:

  - Let's create a way to filter guides by location, price, and availability.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

> **Say:** "Notice that these wireframes are *low fidelity*, and that is okay for now. At this stage, they are used to visualize how content will be organized and how a user might interact with them."

**Remember:** Wireframes sketched on paper are referred to as "paper prototypes."

**TAs,** slack out a link to [Nicely Said: Writing for the Web With Style and Purpose](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321988191?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0321988191&linkCode=xm2&tag=nicelysaid-20) to read after class.

Now that students have a list of sound, real-world best practices to guide them, they should be eager to jump into creating wireframes. Soon! First, prepare students by spending 10 minutes demonstrating wireframing in Figma.

## 12. Instructor Do: Demo - Figma Wireframes (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal for this section is to walk students through a wireframing demo in Figma, which directly supports learning objective No. 2, create digital wireframes in Figma. Building on what students have just learned about UI design patterns and wireframing best practices, this demo is your final step in preparing students for the wireframing activity that follows.

:timer_clock: Set a 10-minute timer. If you do not complete the entire demo, it is OK!

#### After Your Demo:

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Take a moment to check in with the class and see how comfortable they feel about the material covered.

- Stop sharing your screen for a moment and switch to gallery view in Zoom to see your class on one screen.
- Ask the class to use the Zoom meeting reactions found in the Meeting Controls panel at the bottom of the Zoom window to use the thumbs up 👍 or clap 👏 emojis if they're feeling comfortable and confident with the material you've covered so far.

#### Start Your Demo.

In this demo, we will turn a sketched paper wireframe into a digital wireframe using Figma.

**Tip:** Review the solution file if you need to: [04-Week/05-Instructor Resources / Figma Demo Solution](https://www.figma.com/file/wuDtGCw6t9vBkoUrzuHKen/03.3-01-Figma-Wireframe-Demo?node-id=5%3A201).

**Instructions**

1. Make a copy of the Figma Demo Template: [03.3-03-Figma-Wireframe-Demo](https://www.figma.com/file/wuDtGCw6t9vBkoUrzuHKen/03.3-01-Figma-Wireframe-Demo?node-id=5%3A201)

   - On the file title, click the carrot and select duplicate from the drop-down menu.

   - ![Figma](Images/duplicate.png)

2. Using the DEMO FILE page, review the sketched wireframes with students:

   - These sketches are for an imaginary grocery list app. 
   
      - Screen 1: This app lets you add items and check items off your list. 
      
      - Screens 2 and 3: The user can edit their list and delete items they don't want.

      - Screens 4 and 5: The user is shown a modal screen overlay when adding a new item.

   - ![Figma](Images/demo-file.png)

3. You will now use Figma to begin building some basic wireframes:

> :pushpin: **Important Point:**  When preparing for class, review the solution file found in the top left corner of the screen.

   ![Figma](Images/solution-file.png)

   Walk students through the interface:

   ![Figma](Images/figma-shortcuts.png)

   From the top left:

   - Menu [ cmd + / ]

   - Move [ v ]

   - Select Frame [ F ]

   - Select Shape

   - Pen tool [ P ]

   - Text tool [ T ]

4. On the first screen:

   - Add a text label: GROCERIES.

   - Add a rectangle with a text label: EDIT.

   - Group the layers and rename them HEADER.

   - Add a rectangle with a text label and a circle: APPLES.

   ![Figma](Images/05-demo.png)

   - Select the rectangle, text label (apples), and the circle.

   - Click (CMD + G) to group the layers.

   - Copy the rectangle five times using Copy and Paste or the repeat grid tool (Adobe XD only).

   ![Figma](Images/repeat-grid.png)

   - Update the copy to the same copy from the sketch's images.

   ![Figma](Images/07-demo.png)

   - Add a rectangle with a text label: ADD ITEM.

   - Add a color to indicate this button is the primary action.

   ![Figma](Images/08-demo.png)

5. On the second screen:

   - Copy and paste the layers from the first screen.

   ![Figma](Images/09-demo.png)

   - Ungroup the layers.

   ![Figma](Images/10-demo.png)

   - Delete the ADD ITEM button.

   - Delete the circles in the rectangles.

   - Change the copy of the EDIT button to SAVE.

   - Add Xs to each box.

   - Change the color of the Xs to red.

   ![Figma](Images/3-wires.png)

6. On the third screen:

   - Copy and paste the layers from the first screen.

   - Select all the layers. Right-click and select LOCK.

   ![Figma](Images/13-demo.png)

   - Add a rectangle to the screen.

   - Make it BLACK. Give it an opacity of 50%.

   ![Figma](Images/add-overlay.png)

   - Add a white rectangle to the top.

   - Add a text label: ADD ITEM.

   - Add a rectangle with a text label: BREAD.

   - Add a white rectangle to the bottom.

   - Add two lines to indicate a block of content.

   - Add a rectangle with a text label: DONE.

   - Change the rectangle to a background color BLUE.

   - Change the text to the color WHITE.

   - Explain that this is a modal. In user interfaces, modals are used to block the main content of a screen to get users to focus on a specific task. Here the task is entering a new list item.

   ![Figma](Images/wire-3-and4.png)

7. On the fourth screen:

   - Copy and paste the layers from the first screen.
   - Copy another rectangle, move it to the top of the list, and change the text label to read: BREAD.

8. Click FILE > EXPORT (all artboards...) the screens to .PNG files.

   ![Figma](Images/18-demo.png)

Once you've spent no more than 10 minutes demonstrating Figma wireframing, introduce the activity. 

In the following activity, students will dive into wireframing in Adobe XD. At last!

## 13. Student Do: Digital Wireframes Activity (30 min)

**TAs,** slack out the following file to students: [03-Week/02-Activities/03.3-03-Wireframes Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZqQZ1rwtXrLEYc7hPHFaMaTCF96gCaXz8mzTAM0b_4I/edit?usp=sharing).  

> **Instructor Note:** Practicing with prototyping is foundational. Make sure students are getting their prototypes to a place where they can be tested.

**Summary**

Students will create wireframes for the imaginary NSURE app based on their user flow and sketched wireframes from the previous class. This will help them connect the value of last week's lesson on user flow to today's prototyping lesson.

Students are steadily moving toward bringing their apps to life!

**Instructions**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms of student pairs as you describe the following activity. Follow these instructions to pre-assign breakout rooms for this and future activities.

- Broadcast a two-minute warning to breakout rooms to help them wrap up this activity.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will work independently in the main Zoom room during the activity. Open 1 breakout room for students to jump in and troubleshoot.


- First, students will import their sketched wireframes into Figma. 
   - Make sure students share their file with the instructor via Slack.
- Next, they'll use the starter kit tool in Figma to transform their paper wireframes into digital ones.
- Finally, they'll finesse the flow of their wireframes until they're complete.

**Instructors and TAs** 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Request that students share their screens when you are helping them or discussing their work.

Move from screen to screen as student work, making sure they keep moving through the activity. 

- *Watch for:* students who take a perfectionistic approach to sketching and help them keep moving. We want students to have enough time to sketch their wireframes.

- *Watch for:* students who struggle with iterating and want to start from scratch. Remind them about the duration of the activity. They can tweak their designs as needed.

> **Instructor Note:** Not all students will finish their clickable prototype during the time allotted for the activity. Students should either continue to work on it during your office hours or continue at home because ***they'll need a clickable prototype for the next class's activities***.

**Deliverable**

Students will create digital wireframes in Figma and share it via Slack.

## 14. Instructor Do: Digital Wireframes Activity Review (10 min)

Again, not all students will finish their clickable prototype during the time allotted for the activity. Students should either continue to work on it during your office hours or continue at home because ***they'll need a clickable prototype for the next class's activities***.


> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Call the class back to attention.

> **Say:** "Not every designer is a visual designer, but being able to communicate flows visually is very important."

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Feel free to briefly add to this idea by sharing insights about visual communication as an asset for designers.

**Hold critique.**

First, scroll through Slack and select a wireframe to discuss. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Ask students to engage in the critique, responding to students' work over Zoom or Slack.

- Aim to review about one-third of the class's wireframes, if time allows. 
  - Invite students to stay online for office hours for more feedback on their wireframes.

- Invite TAs to offer their perspectives—whether on wireframing in general or students' wireframes in particular.

***Questions to engage the class:***

- *Is there a clear direction of where the user should navigate? Is there an effective call to action?*

- *Does it establish a visual hierarchy?*

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions, whether on wireframes or any other concept from today's lesson.

Next, wrap up class, then open office hours.

## 15. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (2 min)

**Lead a review of today's concepts.**

Spend a few minutes helping students anchor today’s learning through mental recall.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Ask students to raise their hands—or post answers in Slack—and respond to the following concepts, all learned today in class.

- **Concepts to review:**
  - *What do you remember about how to build a clickable prototype in InVision?*
  - *What are some user interface patterns?* 
  - *What are the benefits of wireframes?* 
  - *What do you remember about how to create wireframes using Figma?*

> **Instructor Note:** Take any final questions that remain from today's material, activities, demo, or review sessions.
>
> - If there are any lengthy questions, invite students to stay online for office hours. 

- **REMIND** students that office hours are after class.
- **REMIND** students to bring a clickable prototype to the next class for testing.
- Wish everyone a good night.

## 16. Instructor Do: Office Hours - Challenge Questions (30 min)

Set aside 20 to 30 minutes for challenge questions.  

> **Instructor Note:** Some students will misread challenge instructions. Others will jump ahead. Always ask if they started at the beginning.

***Inspire Participation:***

- Initiate a challenge critique. 
- TAs can participate. 

- Ask a student if they would like to present their work. Seeing others' progress can benefit the whole class.
- Encourage students to make progress. It's hard to provide critique when there is no work to review.
