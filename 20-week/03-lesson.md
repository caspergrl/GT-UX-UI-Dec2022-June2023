# 20.3 Lesson Plan: Freelance Tools and Web-Ready Images

---

## Overview

Today students will follow a creative prompt to code a one-page website. The overarching theme is about wearing the hat of a freelance developer working with a client.

This is the final of three lessons in Unit 20. In Lesson 20.1, you introduced Bootstrap 4 and how to use its components to create prototypes quickly. In Lesson 20.2, you taught how to overwrite Bootstrap components' CSS to customize a Bootstrap 4 template, so students could create custom websites. Today, in Lesson 20.3, students will serve in the role of freelance web developer and export web-ready images from a design. They will then use the assets to create a design file based on a prompt.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Analyze a statement of work (SoW) from real-world project documentation and discuss insights with a partner.

2. Export and organize web-ready assets in Figma or Adobe XD.

3. Code a one-page website based on a prompt.

## Class at a Glance

Welcome to Bootstrap Unit 20.3.

Today's lesson is divided into two parts:

Part 1: SoW: Students will review a SoW and perform pre-coding activities to prepare for building a website.

Part 2: Building a one-page site: After students have prepared their working files and their SoW, they'll use their design and development skills to build a one-page website—Travel California.

> Instructor Note: The exporting of web-ready assets is part of this topic.

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation** to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine Sections review sections or by doing the activity as a class instead of creating breakout groups.

## Preparing for Class

**Review the slides beforehand**.
- [20-Week/01-Slides/20.3-Freelance Tools and Web Ready Images Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13tbTpUmE7VIIMB-89YZBth8MvB8lHjUjj2PhFhnAJmg/edit?usp=sharing)

- Make any teaching notes you'll need.

- As you lecture, relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future goals.

- Look for the :gem: icon, which prompts you and/or a TA to share professional anecdotes directly related to a particular concept.

- Come ready with Bootstrap 4 knowledge. Students will attempt to build a whole layout using Bootstrap alone. Review the following so you can support them:
  - [Bootstrap 4 components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/alerts/)
  - [Bootstrap's responsive column system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/overview/)

- Students will have a lot of questions today. As stated above, students will build a layout without any directions or assistance. Students might ask the following:
  - How do I customize a component to fit the design file given to me?
  - How do I make my layout responsive using the Bootstrap 4 column system?
  - Which component do I select to build the layout?

- Since today is a hands-on practice day, prepare yourself for the time needed to help students, one-on-one.
  - Give extra support to students struggling during the activities.

- Make sure that you're well aware of the one-page layout and key takeaways for all activities before class.
  - Tip: If you have time, practice building this layout yourself using Bootstrap 4 components and four-column system. That way, you'll share the same experience as your students and be prepared to empathize and answer their questions.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [20-Week/04-Time Trackers/20.3 Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zgeWIxoZpKRTIupkVO223krxiOI2Mq9Bg_727bo2tmc/edit?usp=sharing).

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Preparing to Teach Weeks 17-21

**Help students program.**

- Many students will be nervous about getting into programming. Some might even have impostor syndrome. Reassure students that these feelings are normal and will pass. After all, they're learning a new language.

  - Be sure to mention that the best way to feel more comfortable working with code is to *code*! Every coder working today had to begin somewhere. Your students are no different today than coders were when they started. Practice makes perfect; the best way to get rid of impostor syndrome is to practice.

**Share anecdotes about your journey.**

- Don't be afraid to talk about the difficulties you experienced when you first started learning how to program. Knowing that you also struggled will help students feel better about not completely understanding the material yet.

**Encourage pair coding.**

While the in-class activities indicate that students should work independently, encourage students to work together on problems.

- As pair programming is a common agile software development technique, it is relevant for them to at least try it out for themselves.

- If you decide to pair students to program together in your class, try to pair weaker students with stronger ones.

**Download key tools.**

- If you don't already have them, be sure you have the following tools on your computer:
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

**Set up your computer.**

- **Design a setup for teaching that works for you:**
  - During the coding portion of the lecture, some instructors choose to mirror their laptop screen for the projector so that students can watch them code.

  - Other instructors have used different methods to help them facilitate coding, such as an additional laptop, iPad, or iPhone to review the materials during the lecture.

- **Adjust your Visual Studio Code settings:**

- Students need to be able to see the code you display. Make sure that you enlarge the text on your text editor so that the students can see it clearly.

- **Enlarge the text on your screen:**
  - In Visual Studio Code, the best way to accomplish this is with **command and +** for Mac, and **shift and +** for Windows. For reducing the size, the hotkeys are **command and -** (iOS) or **Shift and -** (Windows).
  - Set your font size to 24 pixels:
    - This setting is under **Code > Preferences > Settings > Commonly Used > Editor**. For Font Size, choose 24.
  ![Font Size VS Code](Images/font_size.png)

- **Change to a white-colored theme:**

  - You can find these settings under **Code > Preferences > Settings > Search for Theme > WorkBench.** For Color Theme, choose Default Light+.
  ![VS Code Themes](Images/VsCode_Themes.png)

**BEFORE EACH CLASS: Students must now download a .zip file before each class.**

During this front-end development portion of the boot camp, students will use HTML and other file types during their in-class activities. For this reason, students need to download the .zip file in the Activities folder **before each class**.

> Instructor Note: Please upload only the **unsolved.zip** file to your students' Google Drive and pass out the solved files at your discretion. However, if you think it will benefit your class, you may share solved files with the unsolved files.

**Note:** Here is a screenshot of your class files located in your class's Google Drive. Notice both the solved and unsolved files.

![Google Drive Activity Files](Images/solved_unsolved.png)

**Have students create a folder to contain their activity files**:

![Create an Activity folder](Images/createActivity.gif)

**Have students add their unsolved files into the folder structure, so that they don't get lost**:

![Move files](Images/moveFiles.jpg)

## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Encourage students to come early, use the time provided, and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Today's Objectives (3 min)

Welcome the students!

Open and download today's slides. TAs should share a pdf of them with the students via Slack: [20-Week/01-Slides/20.3-Freelance Tools and Web Ready Images Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13tbTpUmE7VIIMB-89YZBth8MvB8lHjUjj2PhFhnAJmg/edit?usp=sharing).

**Review Bootstrap concepts.**

- Begin class with a quick recap of what they have learned so far about Bootstrap components, responsive classes, and how to customize Bootstrap. Review these key points:
  - Components are used to quickly construct a layout. The elements can then be customized to fit your design, speeding your workflow.
  - The responsive column system always adds up to 12 for a row of content.
  - You can use multiple Bootstrap column classes to control how and when your content responds to different viewport widths.
  - Any CSS Flex property you learned can be applied to Bootstrap 4 because Bootstrap 4 was written using CSS Flex.

**Review today's objectives.**

### Today We Build - Travel California

Today's lesson mimics a real-life work scenario in which the students have been hired to provide a facelift to a client's website, called "Travel California." Being able to properly scope a project will protect the student from being taken advantage of when working as a freelancer.

Today we'll build our website, step-by-step, similar to the manner in which you would develop a real website as a freelancer:

1. View a SoW. In the world of freelance, you always start by defining the scope of your project. How long will it take? What are the deliverables? How much will you be compensated? You need all of this information to properly scope a project.
1. Prepare web-ready assets that you will use on your website.
1. Construct the HTML/CSS for your website.

Get excited! Students are going to be practicing skills they can utilize in design and development work!

**How Bootstrap Fits In**

Bootstrap is used to build prototypes quickly. Today students will apply everything they learned in lessons 20.1 and 20.2. For example, now that they know how to use Bootstrap, its benefits, and how to customize it, they can perform the following tasks:
1. Use components to construct the basic structure of today's website (learned in Lesson in 20.1).
2. Customize those components to fit the design file provided (learned in Lesson 20.2).
3. Use Bootstrap 4's column system to make this layout responsive (learned in Lesson 20.1).

**Connect to Students' UX/UI Knowledge**

Connect this lesson to what students know about UX and UI:

- How UX connects to today's concepts: Students will need to empathize with the business owners when they read the design prompt. How does the prompt alter their design decisions?
- How UI connects to today's concepts: Students will modify the design file to create a better UX for the business they're designing for.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a professional anecdote about concepts you learned early on that are still useful in your everyday design work.

Transition the conversation to a look at the life of a freelancer doing graphic design and web work.

## 2. Instructor Do: A Day in the Life of a Freelancer (5 min)

> 📌 The goal here is to explore how real-life designers work and help students see themselves entering the workforce as designers. You'll introduce some important terms: scope creep and SoWs. This lecture supports the first learning objective of the day, which is for students to analyze a SoW.

Before you dive in, connect how knowing about freelance life has value for students' future careers in UX/UI design&mdash;it shows them what to expect.

### Freelancing Is a Large Industry

Freelancing income exceeds the revenue of some major industries. At nearly $1 trillion (approaching 5% of U.S. GDP), freelance income contributes more to the economy than industries such as construction and transportation and is on par with the information sector.

Freelancers performing skilled services earn a median rate of $28 an hour, which is more per hour than 70% of workers in the overall U.S. economy.

According to [Glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/freelance-web-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,23.htm), freelance web developers make about $75,000 a year.

Freelance UX designers make approximately $122,000 a year according to [Glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/freelance-ux-designer-salary-SRCH_KO0,21.htm).

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** This section directly applies to the real working world of a freelancer. Scope creep and SoWs are important aspects of working as a freelancer. Understanding these concepts will protect students as they develop into UI professionals.

**Say:** "Today we'll assume the mantle of a freelance front-end developer."

There are other lessons that apply to designers as well as developers. For example:
- Having a strategy for developing the scope of a project ensures that both you and the client get what one another wants. 
- Managing the scope of a project benefits you when working for a business.
- Accurately determining how long a specific project will take helps you manage your boss's expectations and complete the project on time with high quality.

Let's explore further and see how lessons of working as a freelancer can apply to the students' professional lives.

>:gem: **Designer Insight:** Share what surprised you—good and bad—about freelance life as a working designer.
>
>- Alternatively, invite a TA to share an anecdote.

Let's discuss what to do once you're offered freelance work, as well as what steps to take to help implement the client's vision of the website.

### When You Get a Project

Generally, when you receive freelance work, the first step is signing a contract with your client that stipulates what work you will complete.

This contract is known as a **Statement of Work** (SoW). An SoW defines project-specific activities, deliverables, and timelines for a freelancer who is providing services to a client.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Relate an anecdote from your own experience with working with SoWs. This is your moment to provide your personal insights to help students perceive what the real world will be like.

If you do not receive a SoW from a prospective client, you should request one—it protects you from scope creep.

### Scope Creep

**Scope Creep** is a project management term that refers to any changes or growth of a project's scope.

Let's say you just signed a SoW for developing a landing page for a website design provided by a client.

A week into the project, you show the client your progress. The client informs you the design team just made a couple of very small changes to how the color scheme and layout look that are really important to the business owner!

Upon reviewing the changes, you note the layout is significantly more complicated than it was previously. To please your client, you make the changes without compensation for the extra time to help ensure that your client comes back to you with more work.

As a freelancer, you just lost money in the form of billable hours and worked for free. Scope creep is not limited to development work—it can affect UX/UI designers or really anyone!

If you agree to make these changes without modifying the agreed-on completion dates, you, my friend, have just been subjected to scope creep.

If a client brings you additional changes that you did not agree to in the original SoW, then you must also modify the deliverable dates and reassess the timeline. This will help you to integrate new changes that have been proposed. Organization is key!

Sometimes SoWs are written with specific terms that allow for changes from the client, but they are usually limited to three passes at most and planned/timed for in the original SoW.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to share a story about scope creep in one of their projects!
>
> - Alternatively, share one of your own scope creep stories—a time it drove you crazy or cost you money or a time you recognized it and addressed it early, saving your sanity.

Now that we know what a SoW is, let’s review a real SoW template.

## 3. Student Do: View a Statement of Work Activity (5 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms of student pairs as you describe the following activity. Follow these instructions to pre-assign breakout rooms for this and future activities. 

**TAs:** Slack out the activity file: [20-Week/02-Activities/20.3/20.3-01-View-Statement-of-Work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zaGzVS0y0Zs_A5GXQzjKqW5rgLJ0vy9YHjysRYz-w7w/edit?usp=sharing) and the SoW template document: [20-Week/02-Activities/20.3/20.3-01.1-Statement-Of-Work-Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUBtdRAJ_bIOmVnL4D-o0UJ-7cVJ7G4heZSmK-wb9Pc/edit?usp=sharing).

### Summary

Students will read through a two-page SoW for a "real-world" company (using a free template provided by Microsoft).

### Instructions

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Be sure to check your #ClassActivities Slack channel for questions while students are working and provide feedback.

Have the class look over the SoW template. Students can use this free template in their own freelance work. 

*If students struggle:* Explain the part of the SoW where the student is stuck or explain they should just review the different sections of the SoW.

### Instructors and TAs

With your TAs: answer student questions about freelancing or how to complete a SoW for a client.

> Instructor Note: Pause and take questions students have about SoWs or the scope creep concept.

Students might encounter the following common problems:
1. Students might have questions regarding certain parts of a SoW.
2. Students might not realize they just need to review the sections of the SoW.

### Deliverable

There are no hard deliverables from this activity. Students should read through the SoW to gain an understanding of what kind of information they need from clients before starting a freelance project.

Here is an image of the template the class will review:

![The SoW](Images/sow.png)
Next, let's review how to work fairly as a freelancer.

## 4. Instructor Do: View a Statement of Work Activity Review (2 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Instead of switching to Zoom gallery view, have students share their answers in the Zoom chat or Slack so they can refer to your shared screen to answer the questions.

Call attention back to the class to lead students in a review of the activity.

**Ask:**

- "What is a SoW?"

	_A SoW defines project-specific activities, deliverables, and timelines for a freelancer who is providing services to a client._

- "What is scope creep?"

	_Scope creep is defined as any requested feature not covered by the SoW that was agreed upon by the client and the freelancer._

- "Why is scope creep bad?"

	_Scope creep is bad because you essentially work for free to please a client, costing you both time and money._

Offer students actionable feedback that they can apply to their work, for example:
1. Always get your SoW signed off on by the client **BEFORE** you begin working on the project.
2. SoWs can outline different aspects of work. For example, a SoW could outline both the design and development phases of the project. A SoW provides a timeline for the project.

Take a moment to give students a sense of some common misconceptions or FAQs about SoWs, for example:
1. In your SoWs as a UX designer, you should offer the client a set number of revisions. Allowing revisions lets the client feel like they are a part of the process and makes them feel good about working with you.
2. SoWs can be but are not necessarily legally binding contracts.

Now that students have viewed a SoW, it is time to introduce the first steps they can take to get started as a freelancer.

## 5. Instructor Do: Freelance First Steps (5 min)

> 📌 Your goal in this section is to introduce the first steps of building a site for a client. Students will use Adobe XD to export web-ready images to be used in their work and create an appropriate folder structure for their web projects. This lecture prepares students for the second learning objective of the day, exporting and organizing web-ready assets in Adobe XD. Today's third, and final, learning objective will be fulfilled by the activities that follow this lecture: coding a one-page website.

**Say:** "Understanding how to compress images is a skill that is needed in ANY kind of design work. Knowing how to export pixel-perfect content will help you create clean, beautiful layouts."

> Instructor Note: As a class, students are using Adobe XD to export web-ready images to be used in their work.
>
> Students will also create the appropriate folder structure for their web projects.

Believe it or not, knowing how to compress an image is a handy skill in the real world. Take a moment to connect this skill to working with design teams in the professional world:

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Compressing images for use on a website is a standard procedure for a UX designer. Uncompressed images slow down an app or website, causing a bad UX. Professionally, designers are expected to be able to compress web-ready images.

### First Steps: Folder Structure

**Say:** "OK, so you just reviewed, discussed, and signed a SoW and are ready to start your freelance project. What do you do first?""

Generally, freelance work will come with a design brief and working files (an Illustrator, Adobe XD, or Photoshop file) for the designer to generate the assets they'll need.

Sometimes the client provides the pre-exported assets, but this is rare, so the designer should expect to create all the assets.

1. Create the project folder structure.

1. Give the project a name, followed by an image folder and a CSS folder.

1. Import images into the images folder in preparation for coding the front end.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to share experience about collecting assets to prepare for building a client site.
>
> - Alternatively, share your own professional anecdote.

### Preparing Assets for the Web

To prepare assets for the web, Adobe XD has several very useful tools to generate jpgs, pngs, gifs, or SVGs that a designer might need for the front end.

A designer can accomplish this in Adobe XD with the export tool, as many of the students have probably already discovered.

The export feature has three options:

- **Batch**: Export assets that are marked using the Mark for Export option. (Shift + Ctrl + E for Windows, or CMD + CTRL + E for Mac.)
- **Selected**: Export selected assets. (Ctrl + E for Windows, or CMD + E for Mac.)
- **All artboards**: Export all the artboards in the design.

> :key: **Key Tech Note:** To export multiple objects as a single asset, group the objects before exporting them.

Setting up web assets is a key step in preparing to code a project. It interrupts the workflow when writing code to stop and have to export a file. You'll want to have all assets available and organized to focus on the code of the site.

Before beginning to code, three things that should take place:
1. Agree on the scope and design of the project.
2. Have all the assets named, compressed, and ready to go to avoid having to stop and search for the correct image in the design.
3. Have the file and folder structure set up so you can focus on the job at hand, coding the layout of the design.

> Instructor Note: Take any questions that students have about getting their assets ready and organized.

Now students know what steps to take to prepare for a web activity. Next, they'll export web-ready assets.

## 6. Student Do: Preparing Web Assets in Adobe XD Activity (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: This activity should be done individually, so you don’t need to create breakout rooms. Instead, make sure the whole class is muted and switch to Zoom gallery view so you can monitor students as they work. Tell them that if they have a question, they should share it on the #ClassActivities Slack channel and a member of the instructional staff will respond. If a student has a question that is relevant to the whole class, you or one of the TAs should unmute and share your answer with everyone.

**TAs:** Slack out the activity file: [20-Week/02-Activities/20.3/20.3-02-Preparing Web Assets in Adobe XD Activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USBqi1PNjyYBkFAGdiaJDFwDh-yyuULLlb28WlY9eEs/edit?usp=sharing).

### Summary

In this activity, students will prepare assets for site design and practice exporting specific assets to their images folder.

> :key: **Key Tech Note:** One of the greatest strengths of Adobe XD is that it allows you to build designs for specific breakpoints/widths of the browsers so the designs come out pixel-perfect (perfect dimensions down to the pixel for all UI elements).

### Instructions

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Be sure to check your #ClassActivities Slack channel for questions while students are working and provide feedback.

We'll export our hero image/icons that will be used in the Travel California layout. This will allow students to see how easy it is to export assets.

*If students struggle:* Students may not be familiar with how to use Adobe XD to export assets. Show them in Adobe XD's menu where you find the export button, or teach the student the hotkey.

*If students complete the activity early:* Share the following [compress images resource](https://wp-rocket.me/blog/compress-image-for-web/) with them that outlines the importance of compressing images on the web.

> Instructor Note: Please make sure students create the folder structure for this project before exporting the Adobe XD assets.

### Instructors and TAs

With your TAs: assist students in either creating the proper folder structure or exporting images correctly.

Students might encounter the following common problems:
1. Students might not know how to export images for the web using Adobe XD.
2. Students might not save their image in the correct location.

### Deliverable

At the end of this activity, students should have the proper folder structure for building a webpage and their assets organized and available for the activities that follow.

## 7. Instructor Do: Preparing Web Assets in Adobe XD Activity Review (2 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Instead of switching to Zoom gallery view, have students share their answers in the Zoom chat or Slack so they can refer to your shared screen to answer the questions.

Call attention back to the class to lead students in a review of the activity.

**Ask:**

- "Why do we need to compress images for use on the web?"

	_Uncompressed images on the web cause our website to load slowly. With uncompressed images, you'll see that the website loads piece by piece when you attempt to load the page—not the experience we want our users to have._

> Instructor Note: Time permitting, spark a discussion about uncompressed images on the web. Ask the class if anyone has ever watched a site's images load top-down.

Offer students actionable feedback that they can apply to their work. For example:
1. Always compress your images before you code; you don't want to discover an uncompressed image when your work has been published on the web.
2. Compression reduces the file size of your image and allows it to load fast.

Share some common misconceptions or FAQs about coding Bootstrap webpages. For example:
- Images that are not compressed will still work on the web, though uncompressed images will greatly slow the load time of your website.

We have completed a lot of prep work! Let's take a quick break before we start coding.

## 8. Break (15 min)

Break time!

**Say:** "We're taking this break earlier than usual. For the rest of the class period, we'll work on a lengthy activity. It's important for you to remain focused as this work will become a very strong portfolio piece. We're breaking now to avoid interrupting your workflow later."

When students return, they'll serve as a web developer building a site for Travel California.

## 9. Student Do: Travel California Part 1 Activity (15 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: This activity should be done individually, so you don’t need to create breakout rooms. Instead, make sure the whole class is muted and switch to Zoom gallery view so you can monitor students as they work. Tell them that if they have a question, they should share it on the #ClassActivities Slack channel and a member of the instructional staff will respond. If a student has a question that is relevant to the whole class, you or one of the TAs should unmute and share your answer with everyone.

**TAs:** Slack out the activity file, **which students will use for all three activities that follow:** 

- [20-Week/02-Activities/20.3/20.3-03-Travel-California-Creative-Prompt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rztg0gCIa41ae82KVAGe5J04JUnifDej7IJRbOb0N70/edit?usp=sharing).

- [20.3-01-Travel-California-Demo-Figma-Resource](https://www.figma.com/file/QryIMF8yDNZPtiQ49PauZa/20.3-01-Travel-California-Demo-Solution)

### Summary

Students need to practice building full websites as well as thinking like a designer. This in-class challenge will force students to apply design thinking, graphic design, and front-end development to build their layout.

Creating a nice design will be a challenging but rewarding experience. It will cement the Bootstrap skills we discussed in the earlier lessons.

### Instructions

First, students will read through the design brief contained in the activity instructions document and make notes. Next, they'll make any tweaks they like to the design in keeping with the requirements outlined in the creative brief.

*If students struggle:* Problems can vary from student to student. Some students might not be able to finish during the time in class. If students do not finish, encourage them to continue to code this design from home.

*If students complete the activity early:* Engage them in a conversation about the case study they're creating for the challenge. What is their case study about? What story are they trying to tell?

### Instructors and TAs

While students are reviewing the design prompt, you and your TAs should talk with students about how they can tweak the design.

If students have different ideas on how to lay out the page, encourage them to pursue their ideas. They have creative control!

Students might encounter the following common problems:
1. Students might have trouble placing a Bootstrap 4 component in the correct location.
2. Students might have trouble working with Bootstrap 4's column system when making a site responsive. Be sure to remind students that different classes target different breakpoints.
3. Students might have general web development questions about how to construct a webpage.

### Deliverable

By the end of this activity, at a minimum, the student must view the design prompt and the design. Tweaking the design is encouraged but not required.

## 10. Instructor Do: Travel California Part 1 Activity Review (5 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms for the groups of students to review the activity. Follow [Pre Assign Zoom Breakout rooms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LxiakaFMQ7FlnhcbgnZvW7bCqGBeDx1SJgZ8qMWVLAg/edit?usp=sharing) to pre-assign breakout rooms for this review.

Have students review their work in pairs. 

Offer students actionable feedback that they can apply to their work. For example:
1. Bootstrap 4 sites can be constructed using components and the column system. How and where you use the different Bootstrap 4 components and code is up to you.
2. Bootstrap 4 components can be turned into anything really. The only limitation is your front-end development abilities.

Share some common misconceptions or FAQs about coding Bootstrap webpages. For example:
1. Always make a plan before you start to code. Jumping into a coding project (even sped up by using Bootstrap 4) will generally lead to poor results.
2. Students who haven't finished should attempt to complete it at home. Nice-looking front-end projects can greatly enhance students' prospects of being hired.

Before continuing, take a moment to ask if students have any questions about creating a Bootstrap template.

## 11. Student Do: Build the Website Structure Part 2 Activity (50 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** This activity should be done individually, so you don’t need to create breakout rooms. Instead, make sure the whole class is muted and switch to Zoom gallery view so you can monitor students as they work. Tell them that if they have a question, they should share it on the #ClassActivities Slack channel and a member of the instructional staff will respond. If a student has a question that is relevant to the whole class, you or one of the TAs should unmute and share your answer with everyone.

Developers build the structure at the beginning for a simple reason: _Once you have the structure of your website built, styling it is easy (and fun)_.

> Instructor Note: Students now move on to Part 2 of the activity document.

### Summary

During this section of our activity, students will build the HTML and CSS for our webpage and execute their designs.

### Instructions

At the end of this activity, students should have the proper folder structure for building a webpage.

*If students struggle:* Problems can vary from student to student. Some students might not be able to finish during the time in class. If students do not finish, encourage them to continue to code this design from home.

*If students complete the activity early:* Engage them in a conversation about the case study they're creating for the challenge. What is their case study about? What story are they trying to tell?

### Instructors and TAs

During this activity, help students who are struggling to build the structure and containers for their content.

This is typically the most challenging stage of development, and students will most likely have questions.

- Make sure to point out to students where they can use prebuilt components to speed their development process:

1. Jumbotron for our hero image—[Bootstrap Jumbotron Link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/jumbotron/).
2. Cards for all the content in Experience Adventure & Popular Destinations sections. [Bootstrap Cards Link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/card/).

Students might encounter the following common problems:
1. Students might have trouble placing a Bootstrap 4 component in the correct location.
2. Students might have trouble working with Bootstrap 4's column system when making a site responsive. Be sure to remind students that different classes target different breakpoints.
3. Students might have general web development questions about how to construct a webpage.

### Deliverable

By the end of this activity, students will have completed a website structure.

## 12. Instructor Do: Build the Website Structure Part 2 Activity Review (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Instead of switching to Zoom gallery view, have students share their answers in the Zoom chat or Slack so they can refer to your shared screen to answer the questions.

Now that students have finished their website's structure, let's review and discuss.

Tell students to take a break from working on their websites.

**Ask:**

1. "What components did you use to help speed your development process?"

2. "Do you feel like using a component helped you develop this site faster?"

3. "Does anyone have any questions about how to use the col classes to build containers?"

Take any additional layout questions.

Offer students actionable feedback that they can apply to their work. For example:
- Using a framework does not limit you as a developer. Everything you learned up to this point applies. Students can use custom-built HTML and CSS in a Bootstrap 4 project.

Share some common misconceptions or FAQs about coding Bootstrap webpages. For example:
1. Always make a plan before you start to code. Jumping into a coding project (even sped up by using Bootstrap 4) will generally have poor results.
2. Students who haven't finished should attempt to finish it at home. Nice-looking front-end projects can greatly enhance students' prospects of being hired.

Now it's time for the "fun" part: styling pages with CSS.

## 13. Student Do: Style Your Website Part 3 Activity (45 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: This activity should be done individually, so you don’t need to create breakout rooms. Instead, make sure the whole class is muted and switch to Zoom gallery view so you can monitor students as they work. Tell them that if they have a question, they should share it on the #ClassActivities Slack channel and a member of the instructional staff will respond. If a student has a question that is relevant to the whole class, you or one of the TAs should unmute and share your answer with everyone.

> Instructor Note: Students now move on to Part 3 of the activity document.

### Summary

In the real world, students must think creatively to implement the designs they're given. This activity provides practice for creative thinking.

### Instructions

In this activity, students will apply the CSS properties they've learned to make their designs look cool!

*If students struggle:* Help them customize their Bootstrap components or columns.

*If students complete the activity early:* Engage them in a conversation about the case study they're creating for the challenge. What is their case study about? What story are they trying to tell?

### Instructors and TAs

Remind students to develop their "Google fu" by looking up questions on Google and trying to solve issues on their own first.

> Instructor Note: If students are still building the structure and haven't completed all of the work yet, that's OK.
>
> **Say:** "Spend this time to style the containers that you were able to build. The rest you can work on at home."

Students might encounter the following common problems:

- Students might forget to use the `!important` tag when rewriting Bootstrap 4 CSS properties.

### Deliverable

By the end of this activity, students will have completed a website for Travel California.

Address students' CSS-related questions.

## 14. Instructor Do: Style Your Website Part 3 Activity Review (15 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Call attention back to the class and lead a review of the activity.

**Ask:** "Does anyone want to share their layout?"

- If students are interested, tell them to share a zip of their work in Slack. 
- Aim to review the work of three to four students to get a group discussion going as well as to provide ample feedback.
- Open the file for the class, review it, and point out the things the students did well.

**Ask:** "Does anyone have any questions about how the layout build went today?"

Offer students actionable feedback that they can apply to their work. For example:
1. Bootstrap does not limit you as a developer. Everything we have learned up to this point can be applied to a Bootstrap project—especially CSS Flex (Bootstrap 4 was built using CSS Flex).
2. You can drastically alter the layout of a component—the only limit is your CSS ability.

Share some common misconceptions or FAQs about coding Bootstrap webpages. For example:
- Failure to complete the website today won't be uncommon. Encourage your students to continue to practice at home to get even better.

That's it! By now, students should have a cool-looking template built with Bootstrap and created in record time!

## 15. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (2 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Instead of switching to Zoom gallery view, have students share their answers in the Zoom chat or Slack so they can refer to your shared screen to answer the questions.

Spend a couple of minutes helping students anchor today’s learning by asking students to raise their hands—or post answers in Slack—and offer definitions for the following concepts, all learned today in class:

**Ask:**

- "What is a SoW?"

	_A SoW is a contract between a freelancer and an employer that specifies what work will be completed and when the work will be finished. This contract details a timeline, compensation, and revisions for the project._

- "What is a creative prompt?"

	_A creative prompt is a document provided to a designer that specifies requirements by the business owner._

### Next Week

Tell students that *next week they'll learn introduce web analytic tools*: Google Analytics and Hotjar for heat mapping.

> **Say:** "To prepare for next week, create accounts on [Hotjar.com](https://www.hotjar.com), and Google for [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/).

**TAs:** Slack out the following links with your class:

- [Hotjar.com](https://www.hotjar.com)
- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)


**Office Hours**

Remind students that you're holding office hours after class. Tell them you're available to help with whatever challenges they may have.

Say goodnight and dismiss the class.
