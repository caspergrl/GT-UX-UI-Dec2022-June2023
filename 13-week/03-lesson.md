- Today, students will work through the definition and the ideation phase of their project.

- Today is a working session for students. Be sure to conduct a stand-up, to workshop with student groups throughout the class, and to help students if they're stuck.

## Preparing for Class

- Review lecture slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/13.1-Group Project 02, Day 03 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SF9eHfjj_Ry-H26E9aOpxTXntMKjkyuHddD36epz3qc/edit?usp=sharing).

- If a group falls behind schedule, assign a TA to workshop with that group to get them back on track.

- Review the [How to Help Students Get Unstuck document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJKtoLw-7bYNvLxRSyUFso64-y0hStQGCOCXp22drPY/edit?usp=sharing) for useful questions to ask during the working session.

- **Remember:** You and the TAs should not be standing around or sitting at your computers. Engage with students throughout the entire day.

- Implement a "workshop" series with individual teams.

  - In these workshops, student teams will rotate among you and the TAs for help on specific tasks. Each workshop should last between 10 to 20 minutes. They're intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Class Materials

- Paper, pencils, stickynotes, large sheets of paper, sharpies, etc.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [13-15-Group-Project-2/04-Time Trackers/13.2-Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I9bRV0lLIIajjQpOjw8cX4eBI6Cxzj0iOvPo0lTWX-w/edit?usp=sharing).

### Office Hours: (45 mins before class) (Office Hours)

Encourage students to come early and utilize the time provided and not to be afraid to ask questions.

> - Do your part by engaging students who come early and participate in office hours.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (1 min)

Welcome students to class and open the slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/13.1-Group Project 02, Day 03 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SF9eHfjj_Ry-H26E9aOpxTXntMKjkyuHddD36epz3qc/edit?usp=sharing).

## 2. Student Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up (10 min)

### Let's stand up!

- With TAs, move among your groups as each team conducts their scrum stand-up. Make sure each team is following the scrum procedure and is literally standing up.

Instructions:

1. Split the class up equally among the instructional staff.

2. Each group member should answer the following questions:
   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.
   - Assign a TA to workshop with groups that are behind or struggling.

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Get groups into Zoom break out rooms quickly and if teams want to do standups via Slack allow what works for their team. Instructor and TA forcing students in an online environment to actually stand during standup could allow be a quick engagement tactic.

## 3. Instructor Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention and review any common themes you heard during scrum.

## 4. Student Do: Working Session 1 (55 min)

### Get to work!

- With TAs, make sure you are rotating among teams. No team should leave the class without being seen or checked in with the instructor or TA.

- **Engagement strategy:**

  - Look for teams that are all working silently or look aimless. Start by interjecting.

  - Create a sign-up sheet on the whiteboard/google sheet to make sure all teams are being interacted with.

  - The instructor and TAs should model good collaborative behavior during project weeks. Mix in and ask questions. Hold your teams accountable for working hard during class!

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Instructor and TAs should move between group breakout rooms use Slack to communicate with groups. We recommend using more scheduling with groups to make sure the instructional staff is not too disruptive to the groups working flow. Don't allow groups to not touch base online collaboration is harder and will require more accountability.

## 5. Instructor Do: Working Session 1 Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.

- Have students share a completed deliverable in Slack.

- As a reviewer, provide constructive feedback using the following format:

- I think this is compelling because ... (note one to two things you like).
- I think you could improve ... (note one to two things you think could be improved).

## 6. Break (15 min)

Have a nice break!

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Don't stop sharing your screen. If you want put up a google timer or a youtube timer video it can help get students back into the zoom room on time.

## 7. Student Do: Working Session 2 (55 min)

### Get to work!

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.

- With TAs, make sure you are rotating among teams. No team should leave the class (in person or online) without being seen or checked in with the instructor or TA.

  - Teams should be working on storyboards and user journey maps by this point.

## 8. Student Do: Working Session 2 Peer Review (15 min)

Call the class back to attention.

Instructions:

1. Students should share their storyboard or user journey map with another group.

2. As a reviewer, provide constructive feedback using the following format:

   - Does the deliverable tell a story?
   - I think this is a compelling storyboard or journey map because ... (note one to two things you like).
   - I think you could improve ... (note one to two things you think could be improved).

## 9. Instructor Do: Working Session 2 Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.
