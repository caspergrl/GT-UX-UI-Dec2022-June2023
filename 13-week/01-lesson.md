# 13.1 Lesson Plan: Welcome to Group Project 2

---

## Overview

Today's class introduces students to Group Project 2—their second independent project. Students will have the next three weeks to produce a responsive web design (RWD) user interface (UI) solution for a nonprofit and present their user experience (UX)/UI design process to their colleagues.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will:

1. Choose a nonprofit to work with.

2. Pitch ideas and vote for the top ideas.

3. Create a proto-persona.

4. Draft an interview plan for communicating with the user and nonprofit organization.

5. Create a survey using Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or Google Forms.

6. Give feedback on interview plans.

7. Compose and submit a project proposal.

## Class at a Glance

- This lesson plan can help you structure the day and keep students on track. If you don't need this guidance, that's fine. The goal of the day is to help students push themselves to make progress on their group project.

- Today's workshop is in three parts:

1. Share the project requirements and workshop expectations with the students.

2. Students will gather into groups of three, pitch nonprofit ideas, vote for them, and set up Kanban boards for their projects.

3. Students will complete the user research phase of their projects.

## Prepare for Class and Group Project Two

- First off, welcome to Group Project 2! Buckle in—you're in for a fun ride!

- Review lecture slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/13.1-Welcome to Project 2 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MiXAcUCOsDBODVoVQy4W7yxw2q-y8G71NNHPSvbWI44/edit?usp=sharing).

- During this project, students will work in assigned teams of three.

  - Instructional staff will guide and support teams as they work through and collaborate on the project requirements.

  - Split cohort teams into three groups. Over the three weeks, you and the teaching assistants (TAs) will check in with your respective teams and guide them during their project sprints.

- Download a copy of the Project 2 Group Template:[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p7lnWB-OQu-J6FdaBGmp10nCCkVw-kAzyJ6jx12FuqY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p7lnWB-OQu-J6FdaBGmp10nCCkVw-kAzyJ6jx12FuqY/edit?usp=sharing).

- **Your main goal:** This design challenge is the capstone of the UI portion of the curriculum. Your primary focus will be on shepherding students through the UX/UI design process. You and your instructional staff will act as mentors and project managers to your young designers.

- **Important:** By the end of the day, students should submit a project proposal for approval by you and/or the TAs.

- **Remember:** You and the TAs should not stand around or sit at your computers. Engage with students throughout the day. Help teams collaborate and mix in to assist with activities, reviews, and questions.

- You and the TAs are to implement a "**workshop**" series with individual teams.

  - In these workshops, student groups will rotate among you and the TAs for specific help on the UX/UI deliverable for each day. Each workshop should last between 10 to 20 minutes. They're intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

  - While student groups will be assigned to work with one member of the instructional staff, these workshop series are designed to give them multiple perspectives on their work.

  - Note: Consider relocating students from the primary classroom to small spaces suitable for group collaboration. Be creative here!

- Take time to review a few of the student project examples in class. Students enjoy seeing where we set the bar, and it establishes expectations for the quality they should aim for in their projects.

- Group projects provide students with practice using the UX/UI skills they've acquired over the past five weeks. As it was for Group Project 1, students will follow the UX process, apply their UI skills, and produce a high-fidelity UI prototype.

### **Help Students Avoid Scope Creep**

You play a critical role in helping students to get focused, stay focused, and manage their project scope.

Without your help, many students will take an unfocused approach to their projects and give weak presentations. Help them keep their focus narrow. While three weeks is not enough time to solve the world hunger problem, it’s enough time to help improve a particular food donation flow.

The Group Project is designed with support integrated to prevent students from steering off course. These supports include:

1. The deliverables and requirements for each day are clearly outlined in the project instructions.
2. Scheduled class standups support interaction with instructional staff about the projects.
3. In-class workshops and working sessions that enable groups to collaborate, get feedback from instructional staff, and set goals to achieve in their project presentations.
4. Work with the TAs to continuously evaluate student groups' goals and make recommendations for limiting the scope of their projects.

### **Common students questions about the Group Project 2**

1. **Which nonprofits can we pick?** Students can choose any nonprofit, as this allows them to improve something they collectively care about. Encourage local organizations. Previous groups have chosen food banks, animal shelters, or gaming for kids in the hospital, etc.

2. **What counts as a nonprofit?** Nonprofits are established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and should be clearly distinguished in the organization's mission. Check the organizations' nonprofit status here: [https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/)

3. **How much of the site do we have to redesign?** The scope of redesign depends on what problem each team is trying to solve for the nonprofit. Groups have three weeks, so they should focus on a problem defined during the research and interview phases. Typically, this breaks down to one user flow of approximately five to 10 screens. Groups must have a high-fidelity UI prototype.

4. **Do we have to keep the information the nonprofit currently has?** Yes and no. If the information is the problem, then the content should be redesigned. If not, then teams should use the content provided by the nonprofit. The students should leverage content from their nonprofits as much as they can.

5. **What styles of nonprofits are recommended?** Local nonprofits typically work best as they allow teams to make contact and care about aspects of their own communities.

6. **What are some best practices and no-nos in this area?** Choose nonprofits that need help visually. Don't choose nonprofits that are divisive. Typically nonprofits need help with aspects of their mission: volunteering, donations, events, or campaigns.

7. **Do we design for the employee or a user?** It is up to the teams to define for whom they're designing. Interviewing both the nonprofit and a user will help identify overlaps between the business and the users.

8. **Do we assume the nonprofit will need to be able to update this themselves in the future?** Yes, solutions are for the Group Project 2 requirements and not meant to be turn-key solutions for our nonprofits.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (1 min)

Welcome students to class and open the slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/13.1-Welcome to Project 2 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MiXAcUCOsDBODVoVQy4W7yxw2q-y8G71NNHPSvbWI44/edit?usp=sharing).

## 2. Instructor Do: Welcome to Group Project 2! (5 min)

### Your mission:

Group Project 2 takes place during Units 13-15.

- Design a UX/UI for a nonprofit organization that solves a real need in a person's daily life.

- You will pitch ideas and then attempt to validate those ideas through user and market research.

### Welcome to your second independent design challenge!

You will work in groups of three.

- Review what a nonprofit organization is.

- Why are we choosing to work with nonprofits for this project?

1. You just completed a government agency UI redesign, and now you'll extend that knowledge during this project.

2. Nonprofits typically need more design help and have more opportunities to make improvements to their UI.

3. There are so many worthy nonprofit organizations to choose from that your teams are very likely to find something that you feel passionate about!

4. Working for nonprofits looks great on your portfolio work!

5. Organizations that are mission-bound are more meaningful to help.

### **Scope Creep**

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Invite students to use Zoom chat or Slack to share lessons learned from Group Project One regarding scope creep. 

One of the biggest challenges students will face during their projects is avoiding scope creep. The key is to keep the focus of your project narrow from the start. Once you have a narrow focus, it's important to keep that focus from widening and growing out of scope during the next three weeks.

> **Say:** "While three weeks is not enough time to solve the world hunger problem, it’s enough time to help improve a particular food donation flow."

The key is to solve one or two specific problems, not all the problems.

If students keep their focus narrow, their presentations will be clearer and more compelling.

> 💎 **Designer Insight:** Bring the importance of scope creep to life by sharing an anecdote from your own work—did a project grow so far out of scope that nothing was accomplished? Alternatively, what about a time that a project's scope so narrowly focused that its outcome was definite and truly successful?

### Review Tuckman’s Team Development Stages:

Review the 5 stages of team development. 

- **Forming:** The team has just been introduced and everyone is overly polite and pleasant. At the start, most are excited to start something new and to get to know the other team members.

> **Instructor Note:** Today/this week may represent this stage

- **Storming:** The reality and weight of completing the task at hand have now hit everyone.  Personalities may clash. Members might disagree over how to complete a task or voice their concerns if they feel that someone isn’t pulling their weight. Remember that most teams experience conflict.

> **Instructor Note:** This week/next week will likely pass through this stage. Work with you TAs to identify groups in the storming stage early and help resolve conflicts to keep group projects moving forward.

- **Norming:** During the norming stage, people start to notice and appreciate their team members’ strengths. Groups start to settle into a groove. Everyone is contributing and working as a cohesive unit.

> **Instructor Note:** This week/next week will likely pass into this stage. Do your best to get teams into the norming stage as quickly as possible. Groups will like get to this position during the group project. H

- **Performing:** Groups are more confident, motivated, and familiar enough with the project and their team that they can operate without supervision. Everyone is on the same page and driving full-speed ahead towards the final goal..

> **Instructor Note:** By week three some groups will likely pass into this stage. Do your best to keep pushing team to perform all the way to the presentations.

- **Adjourning:**

- Once a project ends, the team disbands. This phase is sometimes known as mourning because members have grown close and feel a loss now that the experience is over.

> **Instructor Note:** During the next group project some students will want to repeat working with the same group members to repeat the success they had from the first group project. This nostalgia should be recognized but recommend mixing up teams to see if students can practice the group teamwork process again.

## 3. Instructor Do: Review Group Project 2 Samples (5 min)

If you work hard and execute, you will create an amazing case study for your design portfolio! Let's look at some former groups that did excellent work.

- Group Project 2 presentation sample:

## 4. Instructor Do: Set Workshop Process Expectations (10 min)

Group projects are all about executing the concepts and skills we have gained over the last 12 weeks and putting them into practice. Over the next three weeks, we will be dedicating class time to working.

### Review how classwork time is precious and we don't want to waste it.

- Workshops are about productivity and collaboration.

  - Students should bring materials. Use paper and sticky notes.
  - Use classroom whiteboards.
  - Set up a shared Google Drive.
  - Take lots of photos of your team's process.
  - Get a Slack team going and exchange phone numbers.

### Group projects and workshop class periods are all about collaboration!

Teams must share in all UI deliverable creation and communication. Use walls, large sheets of paper, and sticky notes to visualize your thinking with your team.

## 5. Instructor Do: Successful Teamwork (2 min)

- Your teams will research, define, ideate, UI prototype, and test a responsive web design (RWD) redesign.

- This requires communication, collaboration, and shared goals.

  - Just like the real world, you will not get to choose your coworkers.

  - Be a good coworker and colleague!

## 6. Instructor Do: Review Today's Requirements (3 min)

### Review the Group Project 2 requirements.

  - Make a copy and Slack out the Group Project 2 requirements doc: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iSziofQczIYeMnffiqct51tfXv6Ew3f3fapIA2kDjkQ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iSziofQczIYeMnffiqct51tfXv6Ew3f3fapIA2kDjkQ)

  - We expect you to do a lot of work as a team!

### Review today's agenda.

  - In workshop sessions, you and the TAs will be helping guide student groups through these deliverables.

1. Creating a Group Project 2 Trello board
2. Selecting and getting in contact with a nonprofit
3. Starting user research
4. Creating a proto-persona
5. Submitting a Project 2 proposal

## 7. Student Do: Workshop Session 1 (45 min)

Get to work!

- With TAs, make sure you are rotating between assigned teams. No team should leave the class without being seen or checked in with the instructor or a TA.

### Engagement strategy:**

Look for teams that are all working silently or look aimless. Start by interjecting and get everyone to tell you what they are working on.

- Create a sign-up sheet on the whiteboard with check-in times for the teams with TAs and the instructor for the remaining class period, which will ensure all teams are interacting.

- The instructor and TAs should model good collaborative behavior during project weeks. Mix in, ask questions, and help teams connect the dots of their process. Hold your teams accountable for working hard both during class and out!

## 8. Instructor Do: Trello Kanban Demo (optional) (10 min)

Review a good example or two.

## 14. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)

Call the class back to attention and discuss the deliverables they made progress on and how teams should continue to push the project forward before the next class.

- Strongly recommend that students complete the user interview before the next class. If they don't, the next class can be used for this purpose, but not completing interviews will cause a group to fall behind.

- They will need them to work on transcripts and analyze the data from their interviews to create affinity diagrams and user personas next class.

- This wraps up Day One of project week! We are well on our way!

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.

- Wish everyone a good night.

- Remember, office hours are after class.
