## Prepare for Class

- Review the lecture slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/13.1-Group Project 02, Day 02 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wq1F4pL2MEwHcswZV9-jMbr89O06yfj7M6hBpHGDJGI/edit?usp=sharing).

- If a group is found to be behind schedule, assign a TA to actively workshop with that group to get them back on track.

  - Review the [How to Help Students Get Unstuck document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJKtoLw-7bYNvLxRSyUFso64-y0hStQGCOCXp22drPY/edit?usp=sharing) for useful questions to ask during the working session.

- **Remember:** You and the TAs should not stand around or sit at your computers. Engage with students throughout the day.

- Run "workshops" with individual groups.

  - In these workshops, student groups will rotate among you and the TAs for help on specific tasks. Each workshop should last between 10 to 20 minutes. They're intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

  - If teams have not yet completed any user interviews, encourage them to use class time to go out and conduct Guerilla interviews or call friends and family to do an interview.

- If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Class Materials

- Bring paper, sticky notes, pens/pencils, large sheets of paper, sharpies.

- Work with your SSM to bring in snacks or sweets can also be nice treat for groups who will spend the whole class in workshops and diligently working.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [13-15-Group-Project-2/04-Time Trackers/13.1-Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lY_DPTDZmSsrx-elaDggEnhGBNo6Iqujd9ESh9zH_Gk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Office Hours: (45 mins before class) (Office Hours)

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (1 min)

Welcome students to class and open the slides: [13-15-Group-Project-2/01-Slides/13.1-Group Project 02, Day 02 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wq1F4pL2MEwHcswZV9-jMbr89O06yfj7M6hBpHGDJGI/edit?usp=sharing).

## 2. Instructor Do: Project Management and Agile Process (10 min)

- Have TAs Slack out [What Makes a Great Product Manager](https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager).

### Review Agile:

The most popular Agile framework in software development is an iterative approach that has at its core the sprint—the scrum term for iteration.

### Sprints:

- The scrum approach includes assembling the project’s requirements and using them to define the project.

- You then plan the necessary sprints and divide each sprint into its own list of requirements.

### Daily Stand-up = Scrum:

Daily stand-ups help keep the project on target. For software teams, a stand-up scrum is like a sports team’s huddle.

Teams use stand-ups to answer three key questions:

- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?

**We are going to be holding stand-ups at the beginning of class.**

## 3. Student Do: Daily Scrum Stand-Up (10 min)

**Instructions:**

1. Divide the student groups equally among the instructional staff.

2. Each group member should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?

3. Instructional staff should make notes of which groups are behind.

   - Assign a TA to start workshops with groups that are behind or struggling first.

- > :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Option 1:  Quickly get groups into Zoom break out rooms and with the TAs quickly join team their standups. Option 2: (less interaction) Have all teams issue their stand up in Group Slack channels using the template. Yesterday: ()Today: Blocker: (). Insturtor and TAs look out for blockers or students on the same page.

## 4. Instructor Do: Scrum Plan Review (2 min)

Call the class back to attention and review any common themes you saw with the class.

## 5. Student Do: Working Session 1 (45 min)

### Get to work!

- With TAs, make sure you are rotating among teams. No team should leave the class (in person or online) without being seen or checked in with by the instructor or TAs.

- **Engagement Strategy**

  - Look for teams that are working silently or look aimless. Start by interjecting.

  - Create a sign-up sheet on the whiteboard to make sure all teams are being interacted with.

  - The instructor and TAs should model good collaborative behavior during project weeks. Mix in and ask questions. Hold your teams accountable for working hard during class!

- > :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: The instructional staff will rotate checking in with the teams in their breakout rooms. Review progress, answer questions, and provide guidance while they're working.

## 7. Break (15 min)

Have a nice break!

> :globe_with_meridians: Online Recommendation: Don't stop sharing your screen. If you want put up a google timer or a youtube timer video it can help get students back into the zoom room on time.

## 8. Student Do: Working Session 2 (55 min)

### Get to work!

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.
