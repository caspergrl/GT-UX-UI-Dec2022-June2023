 # 4.1 Lesson Plan: Guerrilla User Testing/Online: Remote Moderated User Tests

---

## Overview

Last class, you led students through wireframing and creating prototypes in InVision, putting them squarely in the prototyping phase of the design thinking process. Today, students will move into the testing phase of the design thinking process and learn what guerrilla user testing is and how to plan for it, how to conduct user tests, and how to analyze testing results.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Create a guerrilla/remote moderated user testing plan.

2. Conduct guerrilla/remote moderated user tests.

3. Document their analysis of guerrilla/remote moderated user tests.

4. Create suggested improvements to prototypes.

## Class at a Glance

This class will be an exciting milestone for students as they're in the *final* stage of the design thinking process and the last week before project weeks. It also represents where the "rubber meets the road," where ideas are reality-tested. Students get to validate their tangible ideas through user feedback.

Today's class is about the testing phase of the design thinking process. It is divided into two parts:

- In Part 1, you'll review a guerrilla user testing case study to prepare students for creating their testing plans, which students will use to test their designs with their classmates.

- In Part 2, we cover analyzing testing results to prepare students to do their testing analysis. Also, students will learn to share their user research with classmates/stakeholders.

> **Instructor Note:** You'll use Airbnb as a case study throughout today's lesson.

- **Guerilla Case Study:** Today’s lecture features a guerrilla case study covering the usability testing process. Refer back to this case study to help make explaining the testing process more concrete.
- **Remote User Testing**: Today's lecture involves remote user testing. Be sure to review the material in this lesson plan carefully so that you can anticipate student questions about it.

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: > :globe_with_meridians:) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examplses of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine an activity and review by doing the activity as a class instead of creating breakout groups. 

## Preparing for Class

- Review the lesson's slides before class: [04-Week/01-Slides/04.1-Guerrilla Testing Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rL2nakIswuH6RAvtsBNu5w6q2UTXx8BgKJWy8t_Lrh8/edit).

- **Preparation tips:** Read through this entire lesson plan, slides, challenge assignment, student activity files, as well as the Time Tracker. 
  - ***Make notes*** so that you are thoroughly prepared to teach and support students.
  - ***Prepare professional anecdotes*** to bring a taste of the real world into class. Look for the :gem: Designer Insight icon throughout this lesson plan, which offers an opportunity to share an anecdote from your professional experience. 
- **Challenge:** Today is the first day of a new unit, so you'll be introducing Week 4 Challenge. Prepare to emphasize the importance of keeping up with challenge assignments. Why? It's how students absorb the deep learning they need to succeed as designers. Plus, they'll get more out of each and every class if they keep pace with their challenge. 

## Class Materials

- If you need additional guidance when preparing for activities or want to see what the outcomes of activities look like, please see the instructor-facing activity solution files:

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Objectives (2 min)

Today's slides: [04-Week/01-Slides/04.1-Guerrilla User Testing Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rL2nakIswuH6RAvtsBNu5w6q2UTXx8BgKJWy8t_Lrh8/edit). 

**Welcome to class!**

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Start class with a quick engagement tactic to get everyone focused quickly on boot camp learning.  

- **It's an exciting week!** This week is a milestone week for students:
  - Students are now in the *final* stage of the design thinking processes: ideate, prototype, and test.
  - Students are also in the *final week* before Project Weeks begin. Soon, very soon, students will collect important feedback, test, and validate the products they've been developing—with real users!

***Remind students:*** They'll need a working prototype for today's second activity, "Guerrilla Usability Testing." 

- Today we'll learn about guerrilla testing. Guerrilla testing helps designers separate their assumptions about what users will like and want and what users actually like and want.

### Engage the class.

- Get everyone's energy flowing and minds ready for guerrilla testing by asking students to draw from their own experience:
    - *Question 1:* Think of a time when you were wrong about what someone wanted, what they liked, or what action they would take. What assumption did you make and why was it wrong? 
      - If needed, get the ball rolling by having a TA share their own "wrong assumptions" story.
    - *Question 2:* What's a process you've used to test your assumptions about people or situations in the past? 

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students engage by raising their hands to speak or addressing the question via Slack. 

- > **Say:** "One of the key lessons designers must learn early on in their career is to get away from their assumptions about what others want."

- Finally, review today's learning objectives.

### What Is UX Writing?

UX writing is part of content strategy. The UX writer is responsible for all the text the user encounters when navigating around a product. If you enjoy writing, you might want to explore this career path. In this course, you'll act as your own UX writer.

- It is the practice of designing the words people see when they interact with software UIs.
- It’s about designing the conversation between a product and its user.
- UX writing is a growing field.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Real-world UX writers are responsible for all the text the user encounters when navigating around a product. This career path is ideal for designers who have a passion for writing. 

## SLIDE 6
UX writers are responsible for all of the text the user encounters when navigating around a product.

### Who Hires UX Writers?

- San Francisco companies lead the trend: Dropbox, Facebook, Airbnb, Pinterest, Google, and Spotify have UX writing, content strategy, or content design teams.


## SLIDE 7
### Content Strategy

Content strategy has been around for a long time. Large corporations such as Disney, Wells Fargo, and Mayo Clinic have had functional content strategy teams for years. So why do we care about it in UX? The answer is simple: it's nearly impossible to design a great UX for bad content. If you're passionate about creating a better UX, you'll also care about delivering useful, usable, engaging content.

### How Is UX Writing Different From Other Writing?

- UX writing is a specialized form of writing because of its context (software) and the environment in which it’s produced (technology companies).

### Lyft vs. UberPool UX Writing Example

- The two screens (see slide) show the same interaction from Lyft Line and UberPOOL.

  - In both, you’ve chosen a shared ride, and the service needs to know how many spots you need.

  - Lyft begins with an imperative statement, telling you what you need to do (“Confirm number of passengers”) and explains why there’s a limit.

  - Uber begins with the question: “How many seats do you need?”

- Both services give you two options to reply to.

  - Lyft lets you choose “Just Me” or “Me + 1 friend,” and shows the cost difference right there.

  - Uber gives you numbers to reply with: 1 or 2.

- This is a pretty simple interaction, and both approaches are quite clear.

- But each service sets a very different tone here.

- Lyft guides you, informs you, then offers you two very casual, friendly replies.

  - By using “Just me” and “Me + 1 friend,” they’ve planted two hints with you: (1) Lyft is for riding with friends, and (2) you can engage with the Lyft service in a casual, friendly way.

- Uber, in contrast, is extremely minimal.

  - This approach is a lot more transactional.

### UX Writing Best Practices

- **Put users first**: focus on the user.

- **Be clear**: jargon-free, use context.
  - For example, the pen tool vs. the Bezier manipulation tool.

- **Be concise**: economical word choice.

- **Make your writing useful**: direct the user to the next action.

## SLIDE 12
### UX Writing Example

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Invite students to write down their own versions of the original copy, below.  Students can share their writing on Slack. 

- **Version 1 (Original)**:
  - At first, we start with a generic mobile screen.
  - *Pay with your phone in stores and enjoy quick checkout in apps.*

- **Version 2:**
  - As we add a brand's voice, we see a personality emerge.
  - *A faster way to pay.*

- **Version 3:**
   - When we integrate the tone, we can see how a little graphic is used to visualize that.
    -  *Everything you need to speed through checkout.*

#### Start Your Demo.

In this demo, we will turn a sketched paper wireframe into a digital wireframe using Figma.

**Tip:** Review the solution file if you need to: [04-Week/05-Instructor Resources / Figma Demo Solution](https://www.figma.com/file/wuDtGCw6t9vBkoUrzuHKen/03.3-01-Figma-Wireframe-Demo?node-id=5%3A201).

**Instructions**

1. Make a copy of the Figma Demo Template: [03.3-03-Figma-Wireframe-Demo](https://www.figma.com/file/wuDtGCw6t9vBkoUrzuHKen/03.3-01-Figma-Wireframe-Demo?node-id=5%3A201)

   - On the file title, click the carrot and select duplicate from the drop-down menu.

   - ![Figma](Images/duplicate.png)

2. Using the DEMO FILE page, review the sketched wireframes with students:

   - These sketches are for an imaginary grocery list app. 
   
      - Screen 1: This app lets you add items and check items off your list. 
      
      - Screens 2 and 3: The user can edit their list and delete items they don't want.

      - Screens 4 and 5: The user is shown a modal screen overlay when adding a new item.

   - ![Figma](Images/demo-file.png)

3. You will now use Figma to begin building some basic wireframes:

> :pushpin: **Important Point:**  When preparing for class, review the solution file found in the top left corner of the screen.

   ![Figma](Images/solution-file.png)

   Walk students through the interface:

   ![Figma](Images/figma-shortcuts.png)

   From the top left:

   - Menu [ cmd + / ]

   - Move [ v ]

   - Select Frame [ F ]

   - Select Shape

   - Pen tool [ P ]

   - Text tool [ T ]

4. On the first screen:

   - Add a text label: GROCERIES.

   - Add a rectangle with a text label: EDIT.

   - Group the layers and rename them HEADER.

   - Add a rectangle with a text label and a circle: APPLES.

   ![Figma](Images/05-demo.png)

   - Select the rectangle, text label (apples), and the circle.

   - Click (CMD + G) to group the layers.

   - Copy the rectangle five times using Copy and Paste or the repeat grid tool (Adobe XD only).

   ![Figma](Images/repeat-grid.png)

   - Update the copy to the same copy from the sketch's images.

   ![Figma](Images/07-demo.png)

   - Add a rectangle with a text label: ADD ITEM.

   - Add a color to indicate this button is the primary action.

   ![Figma](Images/08-demo.png)

5. On the second screen:

   - Copy and paste the layers from the first screen.

   ![Figma](Images/09-demo.png)

   - Ungroup the layers.

   ![Figma](Images/10-demo.png)

   - Delete the ADD ITEM button.

   - Delete the circles in the rectangles.

   - Change the copy of the EDIT button to SAVE.

   - Add Xs to each box.

   - Change the color of the Xs to red.

   ![Figma](Images/3-wires.png)

6. On the third screen:

   - Copy and paste the layers from the first screen.

   - Select all the layers. Right-click and select LOCK.

   ![Figma](Images/13-demo.png)

   - Add a rectangle to the screen.

   - Make it BLACK. Give it an opacity of 50%.

   ![Figma](Images/add-overlay.png)

   - Add a white rectangle to the top.

   - Add a text label: ADD ITEM.

   - Add a rectangle with a text label: BREAD.

   - Add a white rectangle to the bottom.

   - Add two lines to indicate a block of content.

   - Add a rectangle with a text label: DONE.

   - Change the rectangle to a background color BLUE.

   - Change the text to the color WHITE.

   - Explain that this is a modal. In user interfaces, modals are used to block the main content of a screen to get users to focus on a specific task. Here the task is entering a new list item.

   ![Figma](Images/wire-3-and4.png)

7. On the fourth screen:

   - Copy and paste the layers from the first screen.
   - Copy another rectangle, move it to the top of the list, and change the text label to read: BREAD.

8. Click FILE > EXPORT (all artboards...) the screens to .PNG files.

   ![Figma](Images/18-demo.png)

Once you've spent no more than 10 minutes demonstrating Figma wireframing, introduce the activity. 

In the following activity, students will dive into wireframing in Adobe XD. At last!

## SLIDE 36
## 13. Student Do: Digital Wireframes Activity (30 min)

**TAs,** slack out the following file to students: [03-Week/02-Activities/03.3-03-Wireframes Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZqQZ1rwtXrLEYc7hPHFaMaTCF96gCaXz8mzTAM0b_4I/edit?usp=sharing).  

> **Instructor Note:** Practicing with prototyping is foundational. Make sure students are getting their prototypes to a place where they can be tested.

**Summary**

Students will create wireframes for the imaginary NSURE app based on their user flow and sketched wireframes from the previous class. This will help them connect the value of last week's lesson on user flow to today's prototyping lesson.

Students are steadily moving toward bringing their apps to life!

**Instructions**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms of student pairs as you describe the following activity. Follow these instructions to pre-assign breakout rooms for this and future activities.

- Broadcast a two-minute warning to breakout rooms to help them wrap up this activity.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will work independently in the main Zoom room during the activity. Open 1 breakout room for students to jump in and troubleshoot.


- First, students will import their sketched wireframes into Figma. 
   - Make sure students share their file with the instructor via Slack.
- Next, they'll use the starter kit tool in Figma to transform their paper wireframes into digital ones.
- Finally, they'll finesse the flow of their wireframes until they're complete.

**Instructors and TAs** 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Request that students share their screens when you are helping them or discussing their work.

Move from screen to screen as student work, making sure they keep moving through the activity. 

- *Watch for:* students who take a perfectionistic approach to sketching and help them keep moving. We want students to have enough time to sketch their wireframes.

- *Watch for:* students who struggle with iterating and want to start from scratch. Remind them about the duration of the activity. They can tweak their designs as needed.

> **Instructor Note:** Not all students will finish their clickable prototype during the time allotted for the activity. Students should either continue to work on it during your office hours or continue at home because ***they'll need a clickable prototype for the next class's activities***.

**Deliverable**

Students will create digital wireframes in Figma and share it via Slack.


## SLIDE 37
## 14. Instructor Do: Digital Wireframes Activity Review (10 min)

Again, not all students will finish their clickable prototype during the time allotted for the activity. Students should either continue to work on it during your office hours or continue at home because ***they'll need a clickable prototype for the next class's activities***.


> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Call the class back to attention.

> **Say:** "Not every designer is a visual designer, but being able to communicate flows visually is very important."

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Feel free to briefly add to this idea by sharing insights about visual communication as an asset for designers.

**Hold critique.**

First, scroll through Slack and select a wireframe to discuss. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Ask students to engage in the critique, responding to students' work over Zoom or Slack.

- Aim to review about one-third of the class's wireframes, if time allows. 
  - Invite students to stay online for office hours for more feedback on their wireframes.

- Invite TAs to offer their perspectives—whether on wireframing in general or students' wireframes in particular.

***Questions to engage the class:***

- *Is there a clear direction of where the user should navigate? Is there an effective call to action?*

- *Does it establish a visual hierarchy?*

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions, whether on wireframes or any other concept from today's lesson.

Next, wrap up class, then open office hours.

## SLIDE 40
Review Steve Krug quote

## SLIDE 41
Review

## SLIDE 42
The testing phase is where designers get the opportunity to learn more about the user and get chances to refine their prototype—and even their problem statement.

- **Usability testing** is the process of crafting a plan and observing potential users try out a version or prototype of your product. Testing includes recording and then analyzing the results.

- While conducting tests, designers pay close attention to their prototype, the context, and the scenario in which they're testing. Additionally, designers observe how the user interacts with the prototype and collect feedback. By paying close attention, they can see where there are gaps and issues with their design.

Collecting, sorting, and understanding data gathered during user research and usability testing is becoming an increasingly common task among UX practitioners—in fact, it’s becoming a critical UX skill.

As a UX/UI designer, knowing how to craft a guerrilla user testing plan is a key skill that is valuable to design teams. Here's why: 
1. User testing is essential to validating if your solutions work with your users. 
2. Demonstrating you are willing and able to get feedback on your ideas is valuable. 
3. UX/UI hiring managers want to see that you are thorough with your design process, which must include user testing. 

## SLIDE 43
### What Is Guerrilla User Testing?

Guerrilla user testing means gathering user feedback by taking a design or prototype into the public and asking people for their thoughts.

- Guerrilla user testing means going into a coffee shop or another public place to ask people about your prototype. It’s a low-cost and relatively simple way to gather real user feedback.

This type of testing has the following characteristics:

- Participants are not recruited in advance. Instead, members of the public are approached by those conducting the study in the REAL WORLD.
- The sessions themselves are short (typically 10 to 15 minutes) and structured around particular key research objectives.
- The output is typically qualitative rather than quantitative. Testing helps to quickly validate whether specific functionality works the way it is supposed to.
- Due to its simplicity, new ideas can be tested quickly and at a low cost.

## SLIDE 44
### The Process of Guerilla User Testing

Each testing session can follow these steps:

1. Conduct short session lengths.
2. Have few participants.
   - Find out some demographic data about the person such as age, occupation, etc.

## SLIDE 45
3. Observe user interactions. 
   - Conduct the moderated testing session. Begin with your first scenario or task you want the tester to try.
4. Ask about their experience.

## SLIDE 46
6. Thank your participants. 
7. Reward them for participation. Pay for their coffee and give them a gift card.

Always plan research or testing sessions:

- Write a discussion guide, no matter how short or how long.
- Think about where you can go to find users.
  - Consider how the location will impact the testing.

What to do when you are out in the wild:

- Make sure you nail your introduction and plan how much time you’re going to ask of users.
  - How you come across is going to affect how people respond to your inquiries.
  - How you dress affects people's perceptions.
  - When you’re approaching people, be confident.
  - Your body language needs to ensure people that you’re not wasting their time.

Guerrilla user testing is useful because:

- Guerrilla user testing is a fast method that provides sufficient insights to make informed strategic design decisions.
- Guerrilla research can be squeezed into nearly every timetable or deadline.
- Since it doesn’t require much money, most product teams can afford to do guerrilla user testing regularly.
- Guerrilla research doesn’t require specific research skills. Anyone on the product team can conduct guerrilla user testing.
- Guerrilla research can be used to demonstrate the value of user testing/research for stakeholders, especially for those who struggle to acknowledge the importance of usability testing.


## SLIDE 47
### Guerrilla User Testing Deliverables

- Deliverables are typically qualitative rather than quantitative, so the results are often more anecdotal than heavily metrics-based.

- Test plan documents
- Guerrilla test videos
- Summary reports
- Testing presentations

## SLIDE 48
### Where to Conduct a Guerrilla User Test

- Testing frequently throughout a product’s life cycle, as it’s low cost and easy to set up.
- Identifying/correcting generic usability issues early in a project life cycle (e.g., validating an interactive prototype before development starts).
- Conducting iterative design testing, with regular validation checkpoints in agile sprints to keep testing hypotheses/assumptions.
- Getting quick baseline measures of an existing website, app, or mobile experience, including informal user research and insights about user expectations.
- Validating common tasks, such as online shopping or completing a form, where domain-specific knowledge is not required (as opposed to navigating a complex dashboard for a niche user persona).

### Online Remote Moderated User Tests

Remote moderated user tests means gathering user feedback by taking a design or prototype to users through the internet: connecting with real users via the internet to gather data on prototypes. 

This type of testing has the following characteristics:

- Participants are not recruited in advance. Use social media to recruit and schedule users. 
- The sessions themselves are short (typically 10 to 15 minutes) and structured around particular key research objectives.
- The output can be qualitative and quantitative. Testing helps to quickly validate whether specific functionality works the way it is supposed to.
- Due to its simplicity, new ideas can be tested quickly and at a low cost.

## SLIDE 52
### Why Online Remote Moderated User Tests

The world is a busy and sometimes unpredictable place. So design teams need to adapt to new tools for gathering and continuing to test with our users, even if they are not face-to-face.

- There are many tools for interacting with users, but we mostly start with video conferencing and then apply other tools for capturing user testing outcome.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will need to engage in remote user testing via Zoom. 

 - **TAs**, Slack out remote tools.

### Guerrilla User Testing Process

The testing process consists of a few basic steps:

1. Set an objective.
2. Define the target users.
3. Define the questions you want answered (aka research objectives).
4. Define the tasks and the scenarios for each task.
5. Test prototypes and gather user feedback.
6. Review findings and suggest improvements.

## SLIDE 56
**1. Set objective:** For our objective, we want to identify pain points in Airbnb’s current rental booking process.

  - Working professionals ages 24–35 years old who frequently travel for fun and/or for business.

## SLIDE 57
**2. Define a target user:** Target users will be working professionals ages 24–35 years old who travel frequently for fun and/or business.

  - Your target user should align with your user personas.

## SLIDE 58
**3. Define questions you want answered (aka research objectives):** These are the main questions we want to be answered:
  - Can users easily search and book a place to stay?
  - Can users identify and use the wish list feature to save rentals for future viewing?

## SLIDE 59
**4. Tasks and scenarios:** We want to ask users to perform the following tasks after given pre-defined scenarios:
  - Search for a rental for a specific date range.
  - Save one rental to their wish list.
  - Select another rental and go through the process of booking it.
  - Example scenario: “Imagine you’re looking for a rental in San Francisco, California, from Jan 17 to 18 of this year. Go ahead and find a place to stay.”

- [https://methods.18f.gov/usability-test-script/](https://methods.18f.gov/usability-test-script/)

### Summary

In this activity, students will create their plan for guerrilla testing using the provided template. 

This gives students familiarity with how to prepare for taking a prototype out into the world and testing it in the form of rapid, low-cost guerrilla user testing.

### Instructions

- Working independently, students will download the Guerrilla User Testing Plan Template and complete all sections of the template.
- This activity has four parts. Students will complete parts 1 and 2: 

  - Part 1: Students will download the plan template and completely fill it out, including noting their testing location.
  - Part 2: Wrap up and share their testing plan on Slack.

### Instructor and TAs

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Monitor the students' work by navigating from screen to screen. Be available for questions students ask aloud or via Slack.

Students will complete parts 1 and 2 of the activity.

### Deliverable

Students will produce a user testing plan to execute guerrilla user testing and share via Slack.

## SLIDE 63
## 4. Instructor Do: Guerrilla User Testing/Remote Moderated User Testing Plan Activity Review (10 min)

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Ask TAs to work with students who are struggling to wrap up the activity by supporting them in a breakout room or via Slack.

Remind students to share their guerrilla user testing plans in Slack.

***Hold a critique.***

- Aim to review two to three students' testing plans, if time allows.

- Prompt student input:

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students can provide input via Slack as well as aloud on Zoom. 

  - *What surprised you about creating your testing plan?*
  - *What did you learn?*
  - *Is there something you'd like to add to your plan?*

> **Instructor Note:** Invite questions about guerrilla user testing plans in general or the activity in particular. 

- Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about guerrilla user tests:
  - They are only for design teams with limited funds. False; user testing does not have to be expensive.
  - Guerrilla user testing is not using your user persona. Maybe true, but software applications need to be used by as many users as possible. Guerrilla testing might not be able to quickly target your user persona, but you should do more testing and the value of getting your solution in the hands of "real" people will lead to improvements in usability.

- Finally, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can directly apply to their testing plans:
  - Practice your testing script to snare your user testers. Guerrilla testing can feel like you are trying to get a signature on a ballot. Expect users to say "No" and have a follow up to get them to say "Yes."
  - Set time expectation up front. "Hey, do you have 5 minutes to help me improve my app/product/service? I'll buy you a cup of coffee." 

**Connect what students just learned to their weekly challenges:** The testing plans that students just developed will help them complete Part 1 of their challenge assignment—to write a guerrilla usability test that they can conduct.

## SLIDE 64
## 5. Student Do: Guerrilla User Testing/Remote Moderated User Testing Plan Iteration Activity (10 min)

**Summary**

In this activity, students will iterate their plan for guerrilla testing using the provided template. 

This gives students familiarity with how to prepare for taking a prototype out into the world and testing it in the form of rapid, low-cost guerrilla user testing.

### Six Guerrilla User Testing Tips
1. Incentivize your testers (give/buy them something).

   - Be prepared. 
   - For example: Offer a cup of coffee. In the digital world that might look like a Starbucks gift card or a small Venmo payment. 

2. Don’t rely on the Internet.

   - Don't have blind faith that the internet will be working.
   - Have your prototype ready to go, internet-free. For example, have your solution in an analog form, printed out or as a .pdf you can click through.

3. Be prepared.

   - Make sure you have your questions ready to go!
   - Be prepared by printing out your testing plan and questions.
   - Designers should be honest about who they are, why they’re testing, and what sort of feedback they’re looking to receive. For example, "Our team is looking to validate if you find our solution valuable." Or, "We want to see if you can use our new feature." 

4. Present your design clearly.

   - Read each task aloud to your user testers.
   - Wait until the user tester has completed each task before you move onto the next step.
   - Ask your user testers to think out loud during the test.

5. Avoid crowds.

   - Super busy locations might make it hard to communicate.
   - Crowded spaces also make it harder to recruit user testers.

6. Watch the clock!

   - Be mindful of how much time you spend with each test subject and always remind them that they can leave at any point during the test.
   - The last thing you want is a grumpy user skewing your feedback.

## SLIDE 67
### Guidelines for Conducting User Tests

- User testing is not easy, and you need to be patient with your participants.

1. Give test subjects one task at a time. 
2. Let participants set the pace.
3. Let participants struggle.
4. Participants should indicate when a task is complete.
5. Remind them to think aloud. 

## SLIDE 68
### Get the Participants to Think Aloud

- It is hard to know what a user is thinking. One way to try and reveal their thought process is to model behavior and give permission to think out loud.

- Assure them you are testing the product, not their performance.

## 7. Student Do: Guerrilla User Testing/Remote Moderated User Testing Activity (45 min)

**TAs,** Slack out the instructions link for the activity: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.1/04.1-02-Guerrilla-User-Testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZugcgWwaJq-WlvcczKZl8YnsiFv19LlbL58wKF8d9k/edit?usp=sharing).

### Summary

In this activity, students are going to execute their guerrilla user testing plan by conducting user tests on classmates.

### Instructions

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Create breakout rooms for students to work in pairs. Create more breakout rooms than pairs. As students complete their user tests, you or the TAs can reassign them to another testing breakout room. Keep a pair in the main room to preserve the class recording. 

> **Instructor Note:** Participate as a user tester with your TAs. Stay in the main room to redirect students into other user tests. 

- Part 1: Student pairs will load their InVision or Figma prototype onto their mobile phones. 

- Part 2: Student pairs will begin executing their testing plans. The goal is to get students to run tests on two to three test subjects.

> **Instructor Note:** Remind students to use screen recording to capture their user tests.

### Instructor and TAs

Monitor the students as they work by visiting breakout rooms or using Slack to check in on pairs' progress.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will conduct remotely moderated user tests, so they may require more help and adjustments to get used to the online format. We suggest assigning roles with each pair. Assign who goes first. 

### Deliverable

Students will have recorded videos of test subjects and taken notes during user testing, which they'll share via Slack.

> **Instructor Note:** A break follows this activity. The activity review will occur after the break. If students need more time or want to conduct more user tests, allow them to work during the break.

## 9. Instructor Do: Guerrilla User Testing/Remote Moderated User Testing Activity Review (10 min)

Bring the class's attention back to your screen to lead a review discussion. 

Facilitate a discussion around the issues designers can run into while conducting guerrilla user testing. Sometimes it's hard to know if you conducted a guerrilla test correctly until you've synthesized the data! 

### Hold a critique

- Remind students to share their guerrilla user testing plans in Slack.
- Prompt student input:
  - *What does a good user test look like?*
  - *How do we know we're doing a user test correctly?*
  - *What are some risks to guerrilla user testing?*

> **Instructor Note:** Invite TAs to offer their perspectives. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Briefly share your experience with synthesizing user testing data. 

- Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about guerrilla user tests:

  - Guerrilla user tests are only for amateurs or teams with no money. False; user testing should be part of your process and, as a student, you will have to use your grit versus money. Always advocate for a user testing budget in your future roles.
  - Guerrilla user tests are not respected in the industry. False; the gumption to test your ideas with users is essential to solving human-centered problems effectively. 

- Finally, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can directly apply to their testing plans:

  - Practicing with your user testing plan will improve the testing results. Don't assume your plan is perfect. After each user test execution, tweak your process.
  - Look for user testing patterns. If all your users struggled in the same place, you probably have a problem. 

**Help students connect what they just learned to their challenge:** The user testing that students practiced will help with completing Part 5 of their challenge assignment to conduct a guerrilla user test.

### Guerrilla User Testing Process

- Effective UX/UI designers have the skill to get the most out of their testing data. 

- First, ***define user test data analysis:*** To analyze data, designers apply frameworks to testing data that help them identify meaningful patterns in the data they've gathered. Not all of the data is helpful. Designers analyze data to get at the meaningful information.

- Let's discuss the final **Step 6: Review findings and suggest improvements**.

**Airbnb Case Study:** Let's go back to our Airbnb Case Study. The last step in the guerrilla user testing process is analysis. We can break down the analysis into a few key steps.

## SLIDE 75
### Review Findings and Suggested Improvements

For example, we might plot our research data and group user feedback into an affinity diagram. 

   - Some data is sorted by the level of frequency of certain types of comments. 

## SLIDE 76
**Prioritize feedback:** After making an affinity diagram, prioritize the issues based on how important you expect them to be to users. 

   - Sometimes we prioritize based on how important the issues are to users and Airbnb's bottom line.

## SLIDE 77
### Example 1: Write up suggested improvements.

- **Write up your findings and add suggested improvements:** There is confusion around the search button. People rarely realize that there is a filter option.

- Recommendation: Iterate the search bar and replace it with a different icon. Iterate the filter button to include a search option. Change the color of the filter button so that it has higher visibility.

## SLIDE 78
### Example 2: Add suggested improvements.

Users found the reviews confusing (who reviewed what experience and what is the rating?).

- Recommendation: Iterate the reviews page to show individual ratings.

## SLIDE 79
### Example 3: Add suggested recommendations.

Here, we see a different card UI for house listings; however, there is an inconsistency on the site with the use of Airbnb's wish list icon.

- Recommendation: When the user hovers over the heart icon, a label should indicate its function, reducing the number of clicks to save a rental to a wish list.

> **Instructor Note:** Check in with students — "Are there any questions about what we just covered?"

## SLIDE 80
### Example 4: Implement recommendations.

Here, we see a different card UI for house listings; however, there is an inconsistency on the site with the use of Airbnb's wish list icon and share icon.

- Recommendation: Including labels with both features, reducing the number of clicks to save a location.

## SLIDE 81
### Example 5: Building consistency across your UI system.

As designers, it's essential to understand how to present your research to teammates, stakeholders, executives, and clients.

- Research is used to make informed business decisions.

- Knowing your users' needs means you can design a product with value.

For students who want to take things further, share the design brief template so that they can practice sharing their research process: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.1-03-UX-Design-Brief-Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NYa7AhUiN-Y9aFFi0HnpKjNyqzGxTznF0_GPsZ2bZDg/edit).

**Summary**

Students will analyze their guerrilla user testing results by using sticky notes to extract ideas and then organize them—the methodology used by designers in the real world.

**Instructions**

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keep everyone in the main Zoom room. 

- Students will work independently in Miro.
- First, students will study the videos they took of their user tests as well as the notes they took. 
- Then, they'll write that feedback down on sticky notes. 
- Next, they'll organize those notes into an affinity diagram and then into a prioritization matrix. 
- Finally, they'll write down their findings.

**Instructor and TAs** 

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Monitor students as they work and offer support to students who seem to get stuck. Encourage students to use Slack for questions or raise their hands for support. 

If students get stuck on the activity task of pulling out user testing issues, help them by showing them how to refer back to their guerrilla user tests. 

  - Ask some questions: 
     - Did your plan work out? 
     - What didn't work with your user tests?
     - What did you see, and what did you hear?

If students struggle to come up with ideas to write down on their sticky notes, suggest that they refer back to their prototypes or videos of their user tests. 

**Deliverable**

Students will produce an affinity diagram, prioritization matrix, and written findings based on their guerrilla user test data in this activity. They will share their work in Slack.

## 12. Instructor Do: Guerrilla User Testing/Remote Moderated User Testing Analysis Activity Review (10 min)

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Bring everyone's attention back to your screen in order to lead a review of the activity. 

**Hold a critique.**

- Remind students to post their feedback diagrams and/or priority matrices into Slack. 
- Scroll through Slack and choose work to critique.
- Aim to critique two to three students' testing analyses.
  - ***Prompt student input:***
    - *What do you like about this analysis?*
    - *What did you learn?*
    - *What would you do differently?*
  - ***Ask TAs to share insights:***
    - Share what you liked and what you would do differently.

>  :gem: **Designer Insight:** Students would love to hear about your first guerrilla tests. Instructor and TAs, share a brief story about analyzing the results and lessons learned. 
>
> - If you're short on time, entice students to stay online for office hours to hear your testing stories from the real world of design. 

- Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about how to analyze guerrilla user tests:

  - User tests should reveal all of your issues. False; user testing is a continuous process. Don't just test once and call it done. Test every iteration. 
  - User testing analysis is very time consuming. False but true; the design process is the long game but continually doing user testing can shorten the analysis time. 

- Finally, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can directly apply to their future analyses:

  - Document both things that went well and things that went poorly. Use different color sticky notes for each. 
  - Use technology to capture and share your user testing analysis.

> **Instructor Note:** Take any student questions that remain. 
>
> - Students can stay online for office hours to ask questions about the lesson or this week's challenge.


**Help students connect what they just learned to their challenge:** The testing analyses students just completed will prepare them for Part 3 of their challenge assignment—spending one to two hours analyzing and prioritizing the results of their guerrilla user testing.

And, now, it's time to introduce this week's challenge! Then you can wrap up today's class.

## SLIDES 85-88
## 13. Instructor Do: Introduce Challenge (5 min)

**Connect what students just learned to their challenge:** The testing analyses students just completed have prepared them for Part 3 of their challenge assignment. They'll spend one to two hours analyzing and prioritizing the results of their guerrilla testing.

**Instructor:** Summarize the instructions for students. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions and walk through the instructions word for word, if needed. 

**Review the mobile app case study:** Show students what a previous UX/UI boot camp student created: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DwfugswpiXPF3CcXlzQU_JtGf7mIpr2RyjKQ2ozv4xo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DwfugswpiXPF3CcXlzQU_JtGf7mIpr2RyjKQ2ozv4xo).

## 14. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (3 min)

Use this time to review the lesson's key concepts, which helps to move what students learned from their working memory into their long-term memory. 

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students can raise their hands and answer aloud or use Slack to post their answers. 

- How is guerrilla testing defined?
  - *Answer:* Guerrilla user testing means going into a coffee shop or another public place to ask people about your prototype. It’s a low-cost and relatively simple experiment that enables real user feedback.
- What are the benefits of guerrilla testing?
  - *Answer:* Guerrilla research can be used to demonstrate the value of user testing/research for stakeholders, especially for those who struggle to acknowledge the importance of usability testing. 
- How does guerrilla testing prevent designers from creating products for themselves? 
  - *Answer:* We are testing it on users and validating if it works for them, not for us.

**Complete your guerilla user tests/online remote moderated user tests by next class.**

- The value of user testing is that it is fuel for iterations. Encourage students to complete at least four user tests before next class so they can use those results to practice iterating their challenge or class activities. 

- Students can execute user tests on either their NSURE prototype from class activities or their challenge-based prototype. 

> **Instructor Note:** The emphasis is on executing user testing to gather results in order to iterate on their solutions during the next class. Ask if students have any final questions.

- **Remember, YOU ARE NOT THE USER!!! If you are not testing with your users, you are not doing UX design!**

> **Instructor Note:** Ask if students have any final questions.

- ***Reminder:*** Office hours are after class.
- Thank everyone for doing their best work. 
- Stay online for office hours.
