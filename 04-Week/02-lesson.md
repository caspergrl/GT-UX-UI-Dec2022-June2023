# 4.2 Lesson Plan: iOS Human Interface Guidelines and Android Material Design Guidelines

---

## Overview

Today's class will introduce students to the iOS Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and Material Design Guidelines. Students will create HIG and Material Design grayscale mockups with UI kits. They'll spend the final part of the day creating iOS or Android wireframes and prototypes for their challenge. 

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Apply the iOS HIG and/or Material Design Guidelines to your prototypes.

2. Use the HIG pattern library in Figma or Adobe XD to transform wireframes into iOS wireframe mockups.

3. Use the Material Design pattern library in Figma or Adobe XD to transform wireframes into wireframe mockups.

4. Build an iOS or Android wireframe and prototype with Figma or Adobe XD and InVision. 

## Class at a Glance

> **Instructor Note:** Today's class will be shorter than usual by design to allow time in the end for students to work on their wireframes, prototypes, and challenge. 


Today's class covers two types of design guidelines:

1. The iOS HIG design guidelines 
2. The Material Design guidelines

Today's class contains two demos:

1. A demo of iOS in Figma or Adobe XD (Section 3)
2. A demo of Material Design in Figma or Adobe XD (Section 7)

By the end of today, students will be iterating their prototypes from user testing in Lesson 4.1 and will have built—or started building—iOS/Android wireframes. They will then iterate a clickable prototype in class, which is also part of their challenge. ***Students must have their challenge prototypes ready by the next class for testing.***

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).



## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: > :globe_with_meridians:) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians:**Online class:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activity and review sections by doing the activity as a class instead of creating breakout groups.  

## Preparing for Class

- **Important:** Today, you'll prepare students to create prototypes using existing libraries and tools correctly. Before class, review the following resources on the iOS HIG and Material Guidelines:
    - [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/)
- [https://material.io/design/](https://material.io/design/)

- **Preparation tips:** read through this entire lesson plan, slides, student activity files, as well as the Time Tracker.  
  - ***Make notes*** so that you are thoroughly prepared to teach and support students.
  - ***As you lecture*** relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future careers. Look for the :gem: - Designer insight icon throughout this lesson plan, which offers an opportunity to share an anecdote from your professional experience.

**Review your lecture slides:**
    - [04-Week/01-Slides/04.2-iOS and Material Design Guidelines Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H48zAVSzaXl8MDNgX_PIXjEHdvqIqhtLdPWk2XOqLHI/edit?usp=sharing).

**Practice your demos *at least twice*:**
    - Section 3: You'll demo iOS in Figma or Adobe XD.
        - Section 7: You'll demo Material Design in Figma or Adobe XD. 

**Summarize the activity instructions out loud:**

  - Students will readily dive into the activities if you provide verbal guidance. There's no need to read the instructions word for word, but do summarize the key steps.

**Emphasize the value of challenge and keeping up with it:**

- The weekly challenge is built with class lessons in mind—each week teaches them what they need to know to complete more of the challenge. 
- challenge is where students practice what they're learning and how they prepare for future careers in design.  


- **Reminder:** Next class will be the last lesson of the UX portion of the boot camp. Next week, students will start Project 1 (project weeks 5, 6, and 7). Following that, they will move into UI (in week 8).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Objectives (2 min)

- Open and download today's slides. TAs should share them with the students via Slack: [04-Week/01-Slides/04.2-iOS Human Interface Guidelines Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H48zAVSzaXl8MDNgX_PIXjEHdvqIqhtLdPWk2XOqLHI/edit#slide=id.g619bba08c7_0_0).

**Welcome to class!**

 > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Start the class out with a quick engagement tactic to get everyone focused on the boot camp content.   

- **Say:** "Today we're studying the guidelines for designing on iOS and Android phones. This will prepare you to design the best possible wireframes during the last portion of class." 

- Connect the last class to the goals of Unit 4:
  - Our goal in this unit is for you to create ready-to-test prototypes. 
  - Last class, you studied guerrilla user testing and analysis. Next class, you will use that knowledge for running tests. In order for you to have a prototype that's appropriate for testing, you must first understand the Apple and Android device design guidelines—that's today's focus. 

- *Remind students:* They will work on their wireframes for the last 40 minutes of class and develop prototypes as part of their challenge. ***Everyone needs to have their prototypes ready by next class for user testing.*** 

- Connect the design thinking model to what you're teaching today: We are in the second diamond and practicing the cycle of ideate > prototype > test.

**Engage the class.**
  - Get everyone's energy flowing and minds ready for understanding the guidelines they'll learn about today by asking students to draw from their own experience:
    - *Question 1:* Think of a time when you referred to guidelines in order to learn how to format something, whether for school, a job, or another pursuit. What role did the guidelines play?
    - *Question 2:* When have you used guidelines to design or build something technical?

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students engage by raising their hands to speak or addressing the question via Slack. 

- Review today's learning objectives.

Now, get ready to dive into the design guidelines for Apple's human interface. 

## 2. Instructor Do: Design Guidelines and iOS HIG (20 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your first goal for this section is to familiarize students with the concept of design guidelines. Your second goal is to show students what's unique and important about Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for iOS. This lecture prepares students to achieve today's first learning objective: to apply the design guidelines. 

In the last class, students practiced user testing (guerrilla/remote moderated) and hopefully have some user testing data to make iterations. Today, they're folding in user testing iterations and moving forward with their wireframes and prototypes, which they'll test in the next class.

> **Instructor Note:** Encourage students to use their challenge prototypes to maximize the class time towards this weeks challenge.

## SLIDE 6
- **Design guidelines** are sets of recommendations for good practices in design.

- Design guidelines provide designers and developers with clear instructions on how to adopt specific usability principles.

- Design guidelines let designers create an experience that is 
    - intuitive
    - learnable
    - efficient
    - consistent

## SLIDE 7
### iOS and Android Design Guidelines

In the mobile phone operating system (OS) marketplace, Android has a 75% market share while iOS has 24%. Naturally, Android's and iOS's design guidelines dominate mobile apps. We're learning about both guidelines today.

- **TAs,** slack out: [iOS-Market-Share](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide) for students to review after class.

## SLIDE 9
### iOS HIG

iOS HIG is a design language developed by Apple to provide continuity across its web and mobile products.

- **TAs,** slack out: [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)

## SLIDE 10
- **iOS components**

    - Views, controls, and bars allow app developers to build iOS interfaces quickly. 

    - If you work at Apple as a UX designer, you might be able to impact these UI elements. If not, just implement them faithfully. Nothing makes a young designer look more "green" than ignoring iOS standards. 

## SLIDE 11
- **Navigation bars** contain the controls for navigating through an app’s screens or views. They'll always appear at the top of the screen, immediately below the status bar.

## SLIDE 12
- **Search bars** can be displayed alone, in a navigation bar, or a content view.

## SLIDE 13
- **Tab bars** are used to allow the user to navigate through the separate views of an application quickly. They always appear at the bottom edge of the screen.

## SLIDE 14
- **Table views** are used to display small to large amounts of list-style information.

## SLIDE 15
Review

## SLIDE 16
The goal in designing scalable products is to consider all your users. Usability and accessibility play huge roles in making scalable design.

- **Vision and contrast:** Vision impairments include blindness, color blindness, all forms of vision loss, and challenges and situations that make seeing the screen uncomfortable or difficult.
- **Hearing and audio:** Hearing impairments include all types of hearing loss and situations in which people don't want their devices to make noise, such as when they're in a theater.
- **Physical and motor:** Apple provides several accommodations to help people use their devices without the need for fine motor control.
- **Literacy and Learning:** Literacy and learning challenges include difficulty speaking and reading, managing complexity, and staying focused.

**TAs,** slack out the following for students to review at home:

Questions??

## SLIDE 18
Review

## SLIDE 19
**Loading:**

- Make it clear when loading is occurring.
- **Ask,** "What might your user think if you do not make it clear that loading is occurring?"

## SLIDE 20
**Modality:**

- Use modality to create focus.
- Prevent people from doing other things until they complete a task or dismiss a message or view.

## SLIDE 21
**Ask for permission:**

- People expect to have control over their private data. In iOS, users must grant permission for an app to access personal information, including photos and contact information.
- **Ask,** "Why do we need to ask individual permissions from our users to access their content?" 

  - For example, multiple international and domestic laws require that these permissions be requested (such as the EU's Data Protection Directive and ePrivacy Directive and California's COPPA) and that Apple requires them if you want the app to be available in the Apple App Store.

## SLIDE 22
**Settings:**

- Settings are a necessary part of the UX.
- Thoughtfully prioritize configuration options within your app.
- Expose infrequently changed configuration options in the settings.

**iOS HIG - Eight Best Practices**

Let's talk about the best practices for applying the iOS guidelines to our designs.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Choose one to two of the following as the basis for an anecdote while you are lecturing. This will help students connect what they're learning to the real world. 

1. **Treat typography as content.**

   - Make your type legible and give your type a clear hierarchy.

## SLIDE 25
2. **Make text readable.**

   - Use at least 11 point size, so it's legible at a regular viewing distance.
   - We'll cover more in the UI units.

## SLIDE 26
3. **Use appropriate font sizes.**

   - Type is for reading, so make sure it is legible.

## SLIDE 27
4. **Use large titles.**

   - Bold fonts are everywhere in iOS 13.
   - Titles are now big and black.
   - Since screens are about twice as tall as they were with previous iPhones, it only makes sense to have large titles. Another reason for large fonts is accessibility.
   - With millions of people of all ages using their phones daily, making the content as clear and readable as possible is essential.

## SLIDE 28
5. **Focus on alignment.**

   - Grids are essential in maintaining consistent alignment.

## SLIDE 29
6. **Organization matters.**

   - Content should be ordered and clear.

## SLIDE 30
7. **Consider tap targets.**

   - Make a point of 44x44 pixels.

## SLIDE 31
8. **Use a prominent color for touchable areas.**

   - The user should clearly understand what they can interact with.

**Designing for iPhone X:** The iPhone X requires some special attention.

- When designing apps for the iPhone X, you have to be aware of the safe zone and layout margins. The safe zone ensures your app UI doesn’t get clipped by the device’s sensors or corners.

**TAs,** slack out the following for students to review at home: 

- [https://designcode.io/ios11-iphone-x](https://designcode.io/ios11-iphone-x)

- [https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/)

Building on these iOS design guidelines, you'll demo Apple's resources for iOS designers.

## SLIDES 35-36
## 3. Instructor Do: Demo - iOS in Figma or Adobe XD (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal for this section is to give a demo using iOS resources to help students feel comfortable using the tools themselves.

Here, you'll introduce students to the iOS resources, then provide time to practice using and iterating with the tools.

**Remind students:** They'll continue to learn these tools over time. You'll share more resources to improve their wireframing skills. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Demo Figma for online classes.

- To demo Figma, go to: [https://www.figma.com/community/file/829177623045431222](https://www.figma.com/community/file/829177623045431222). Duplicate the community resource. 

  - **TAs:** share the Figma resource in Slack.

If demoing Adobe XD, go to the design resource and download the iOS Adobe XD file: [https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/).

- **TAs**, share the Adobe XD resource in Slack.

### Set up your demo.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Navigate away from the slideshow for this demonstration. If you shared your entire desktop, make sure to open your files on that shared desktop. If you shared a single window, be sure to re-share your screen to capture the appropriate window or desktop.

- Remember to narrate what you are doing during transitions and demonstrations. In this instance, you might say: “I’m now going to switch from the slideshow to another tab so I can demonstrate a task.”

Since you’ll be sharing your screen for this demonstration, ask students to use the raise hands feature on Zoom to ask questions. At a good breaking point, call on a specific student to unmute and ask their question. Alternatively, you can ask students to share their questions in the Zoom chat and have the TA provide answers in the chat.

- Ask a TA to set a timer for 10 minutes to track your time. 

- Don't go over time; you can share more with students after class wraps up, during office hours, if needed.


**Windows students:** Students using Windows will not be able to download the library from the Apple website. Slack out this link containing the Adobe XD files for Windows students to use: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.2/XD iOS Library Resources/Windows](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1fnTiRSUv8ctwoGSNMERxiZziyycxHN7Y). ![Apple iOS](Images/iOS.png)

### Start your demo.

Walk through the following steps for students:

Part 1: Review Resource 

1. Download iOS Figma/Adobe XD resources.

2. Open the Figma/Adobe XD file "UIElements+DesignTemplates+Guides-iPhone8."

3. Explore the components supplied in the file from Apple.

   - Many Apple designers want to share their knowledge.

   - We can build apps faster because of these shared design languages and UI components.

   - **If it feels like cheating, it is not! We should maximize the resources provided.**

4. Review the iOS symbols and the design library supplied in the Figma or Adobe XD resource.

Part 2: Wireframe a Login Screen

> **Instructor Note:** Make sure to vocalize your actions using the software and remind students they will practice next and should continue at home.


1. Create a New Artboard for the mobile iPhone 8 or 10.

2. Relabel the screen "01-Homepage-Login"

3. Add a mobile grid - 4 columns.

4. Create a text box to the left of the screen and add an outline for a login page element requirements.

5. Build a quick wireframe for a login screen using the iOS resources.

   - Add components top down. If you want to make an outline or talk through what is required on a login page first, that will help students. 

   - Make sure to group elements and relabel them in your layers/assets panel.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for any questions. 

***You won't "run out" of time:***  Don't worry about "finishing" your demo. If students need to see parts of your demo again while they work, you can show them during the activity. 

Students should be very eager at this point to practice wireframing, the next activity. Turn them loose.

## 4. Student Do: iOS Wireframes Activity (25 min)

**TAs,** slack out the instructions and the iOS Design Guidelines Cheat Sheet: 

- Activity instructions: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.2/04.2-01-iOS-Wireframes-Activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBEpePGENhpDsj1hedh8yq0KjoiW0KEnkQZvaT7tSQE/edit?usp=sharing)

> **Instructor Note:** This activity gives students an opportunity to meet today's second learning objective, use the HIG pattern library for iOS in Figma or Adobe XD. Recommend students use their challenge Prototype to maximize classtime towards their challenge.


> 💼**Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, using the HIG pattern library is relevant to the industry because you might want to get a UX job working on iOS applications. 

### Summary

Students will practice taking a digital wireframe and transforming it into an iOS wireframe, which should follow the developer guidelines and design patterns for iOS.

### Instructions

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keep students in the main Zoom room for this activity. If they need to see portions of the demo again, you can show it by sharing your screen. 

- Students will work independently.
- Part 1: Students will download and familiarize themselves with the iOS Library from Figma or Adobe XD Resources. 
- Part 2: Students will digitize their wireframes to be compatible with iOS guidelines. Students can use a digital wireframe from their challenge or the previous class activity.
- Part 3: Wrap up and post work to Slack! 

### Instructor and TAs

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students may struggle to recall certain portions of your demo, so be prepared to share your screen and go over certain demo portions again. Students who need help will watch your screen, and students who don't will stay focused on their work.

*Possible trouble spots to watch out for and how to remediate*:

- Students might struggle to add elements, so help them to use copy and paste or hold down Option to create a copy.
- Students might struggle to align items, so help them to use a grid and use the align/distribute tools.

### Deliverable

Students will create two to three iOS wireframes in Figma or Adobe XD and post their work to Slack.

## SLIDE 39
## 5. Instructor Do: iOS Wireframes Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention and lead a review of the activity. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have the TAs help students who haven't finished their wireframes via Slack or by creating a breakout room.

### Hold critique.

- Scroll through the work posted in Slack and choose the first set of wireframes to review.
- Aim to review two to three sets of iOS wireframes with the class. 

### Questions to stimulate conversation:

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Invite students to participate by raising their hands to speak or by posting in Slack. 

- *What is working well with this wireframe?*
- *What is one thing that could be different about this wireframe?*
- *What did you learn from this wireframe?*

Invite TAs to provide feedback and insights. 

Offer your own, too. 

Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about creating iOS wireframes:

- iOS components don't have any usability issues. False: although they try to make highly usable interface elements, be mindful of which components you are applying and why.
- iOS components don't apply to apps on the iOS platform. True and false: Apple can reject applications from their platform if they don't reach a level of quality in the interface. Applying iOS best practices in your executions can help assure your solutions don't get rejected. 

Finally, with the challenge in mind, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can directly apply to their prototypes:

- Although using iOS components is fun, the digitized executions are still wireframes, so don't get too carried away with adding color. 
- Do not use all the components just because you can. As with cooking, avoid throwing in all the spices at once and follow the recipe. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

**Help students connect the learning to the challenge:** The wireframes students worked on will prepare them for executing Part 5 of their challenge assignment—creating iOS wireframes.

## 6. Instructor Do: Material Design Guidelines (15 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** This section aims to familiarize students with the two main concepts in Material Design: (1) the use of shadow to indicate elements and the state, and (2) the use of Material UI components. This lecture also addresses today's first learning objective, knowing which design guidelines to apply.

Now that you have reviewed the iOS HIG, it's time to discuss Material Design.

Here you will cover the high points of Google's Android design guidelines, much as you did for iOS.

**Ask**, "Who knows what Material Design is used for?"

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students engage by raising their hands to speak or addressing the question via Slack.

### What Is Material Design?

Material Design is a design language developed by Google to provide continuity across its web and mobile products. Just like its name, it was inspired by real materials and combined them into one design system to create a sleek, intuitive, beautiful, and interactive UX.

> 💼 **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, reading and understanding *a variety of operating systems' design guidelines* is relevant to the industry because many of you might go work on applications that are on Android. Or even go work for Google.

### Why Does Material Design Matter?

Material Design provides a uniformity of experience that Google products have been lacking. Its mobile-centric focus also represents an important shift in the company's approach to design.

**TAs,** slack out these Material Design resources, which students can refer to during their next activity:

## SLIDE 43
Review

## SLIDE 44
Three main principles construct Material Design: 

1. Material is the metaphor. The development of the material was inspired by the study of tactile elements we use every day, such as paper and ink. It makes the object light, and the surface and movements are better when interacting with each other.

2. Make designs bold, graphic, and intentional. Typography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery used in the print-based design makes the content better. 

3. Motion provides meaning. This is one of the most noted things. In material, you should have meaningful and appropriate motion, subtle and clear feedback, as well as efficient and coherent transition.


## SLIDE 45
### Material Design Principles Are Rooted in Reality

Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows. Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink as digital objects.

![Material 3D](Images/material-3d.png)

- The material environment is a three-dimensional space, which means all objects have x, y, and z dimensions.

In Material Design, we're trying to mimic the concept of picking up a piece of paper, which would generate a shadow on a table's surface, for instance.  The elevation is the relative distance between two surfaces along the z-axis.

**Elevation**

All Material Design surfaces and components have elevation values. Surfaces at different elevations do the following:

- Allow surfaces to move in front of and behind other surfaces, such as content scrolling behind app bars.
- Reflect spatial relationships, such as how a floating action button’s shadow indicates it is separate from a card collection.


- **TAs please Slack out** Read more about elevation here: [https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html).

## SLIDE 47
**Shadow**

Material surfaces cast shadows when they obstruct light sources. The consistent use of shadow depicts the elevation. Shadows express the degree of height between surfaces and should be used consistently across a product.

- The basic material surface is opaque white, with 1dp thickness, and casts a shadow. All UI elements in Material Design result from modifications to this surface.

- Read more about light and shadow here: [https://material.io/design/environment/light-shadows.html#light](https://material.io/design/environment/light-shadows.html#light).

Review

## SLIDE 49
Material Design has three-dimensional qualities reflected in its use of surfaces, depth, and shadows. For example, shadows provide useful cues about an object’s direction of movement and whether the distance between surfaces increases or decreases.

Example 1:
- DON'T: Without a shadow to indicate elevation, it’s unclear whether this square is increasing in size or increasing its elevation.
- DO: Use consistent shadow to help the user understand that the object is changing shape as opposed to changing elevation.

## SLIDE 50
Example 2:

- DO: Use shadows to make differences in surface elevation perceptible. The smaller, sharper shadow of the app bar (1) indicates it is at a lower elevation than the menu (2).
- DON'T: The lack of shadows or other visual cues to indicate edges and surface overlap creates insufficient contrast between surfaces.

Example 3:

- DO: Use a translucent background to indicate surface overlap, but not the degree of elevation.
- DON'T: The lack of shadows or scrimmed background makes it difficult to distinguish the background's dialog box.

## SLIDE 51
For example, we can notice how shadows are used to convey the state of a button:

- Normal has a small shadow to indicate that it is a button.
- Pressed has a larger shadow to indicate that something has changed.

## SLIDE 52
We see this same type of relationship with cards.

## SLIDE 53
### Material Design Surface Positioning and Movement

Surfaces, aka UI components, can remain fixed on the x- and y-axes or can be moveable in any direction. Review the examples:

A. The top app bar (1) remains in a fixed position while the card collection scrolls only vertically behind it.
B. Surfaces can move independently of each other.
C. Surfaces (1) can move in any direction, although movement can be confined to a single axis at a time.

## SLIDE 54
### Material Design Navigation Patterns

Like iOS, Material Design has many UI patterns. Like iOS, material has a bottom button tab. They also encourage the use of tabs for top navigation as well.

## SLIDE 55
**Reverse Navigation**

Reverse navigation refers to backward movement between screens. It can move users chronologically through their recent screen history, or upward through an app’s hierarchy. Unlike iOS, Android uses a back button on the bottom bar.

## SLIDE 56
- Like iOS, upward navigation-when navigation icons are at the top of the screen-are possible as well.

## 7. Instructor Do: Demo - Material Design in Figma or Adobe XD (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal for this section is to demo using Material Design resources so that students feel confident in the activity that follows.

First, you'll introduce students to the iOS resources. Then you'll allow them time to practice using and iterating with their tools.

**Remind students:** Learning these tools takes time. While you'll share more resources to improve students' wireframing skills, they should be practicing at home. 

### Set up the demo.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Ask a TA to set a timer for 10 minutes to track your time. 

- Don't go over time; you can share more with students after class wraps up, during office hours, if needed.

> **Instructor Note:** If you demoed Figma with iOS, stick with Figma and vice versa.

**Demoing Figma:** Go to and duplicate the Material Baseline Design Kit. [https://www.figma.com/community/file/778763161265841481](https://www.figma.com/community/file/778763161265841481)

**Demoing Adobe XD:** Go to the Adobe design resources link and download the Material Design UI Kit Adobe XD file:

[https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/resources.html](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/resources.html)

- Click UI Kits.

 ![Material Design](Images/material.png)

### Give the demo.

Walk through the following steps for students:

### Demo Part 1: Review

1. Download Material Design Figma or Adobe XD resources.

2. Open Figma or Adobe XD file "xd-resource-material-design.xd."

3. Explore the components supplied in the file from Adobe.

   - We can build apps faster because of these shared design languages.

   - **If it feels like cheating, it is not! We should maximize the resources provided.**

4. Review the Android symbols and the design library supplied in the Figma or Adobe XD resource.

**Demo Part 2: Material Wireframe**

1. Create a new artboard for the mobile iPhone 8 or 10.

2. Build a quick wireframe for a login screen using Android resources.

Again, don't worry about "finishing" the demo. 

***Remember:*** If students need to see parts of your demo again while they work, feel free to show them. 

Students should be very eager at this point to get hands-on and jump into wireframing. That's next! 

## SLIDE 59
## 8. Student Do: Android Wireframes Activity (25 min)

**TAs,** slack out the instructions and the Material Design Guidelines:

- Instructions: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.2/04.2-02-Android-Wireframes-Activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NEYHtr_8VUp08OTGMvtM3Wtxxm3FRjx5ddkqecUgnj4/edit?usp=sharing).

- Slack out: [https://material.io/components/app-bars-bottom/](https://material.io/components/app-bars-bottom/).

> **Instructor Note:** This activity gives students an opportunity to meet today's third learning objective, use the Material Design pattern library in Figma or Adobe XD. 

> 💼 **Employer competitive note:** As a UX/UI designer, using the Material Design pattern library is relevant to the industry because they must be able to be versatile designers who can consider different platforms. 

### Summary

Students will practice taking a digital wireframe and transforming it into an Android wireframe. The wireframes should follow the developer guidelines and design patterns.

### Instructions

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keep students in the main Zoom room for this activity. If they need to see portions of the demo again, you can show it by sharing your screen. 

- Everyone will work independently. 
- Students can use a digital wireframe from their challenge or the previous class activity.
- Part 1: Students will download and familiarize themselves with the Material Design Library from Figma or Adobe XD Resources. 
- Part 2: They'll digitize their wireframes to be compatible with Android guidelines. 
- Part 3: Wrap up and share your work!

### Instructor and TAs

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Monitor students as they work and offer support where needed, whether via Slack or sharing your screen.

*Possible trouble spots to watch out for and how to remediate*:

- Students might struggle to add elements, so help them to use copy and paste or hold down options to create a copy.

- Students might struggle to align items, so help them to use a grid and use the align/distribute tools.

### Deliverable

Students will create three to five Android wireframes in Figma or Adobe XD and share them via Slack.

## SLIDE 60
## 9. Instructor Do: Android Wireframes Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention and lead a review of the activity. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have the TAs help students who haven't finished their wireframes via Slack or by creating a breakout room.

### Hold critique.

- Scroll through the Android wireframes posted in Slack and choose the first set of wireframes to review.
- Aim to review two to three sets of Material wireframes with the class. 

### Questions to stimulate conversation:

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Invite students to participate by raising their hands to speak or by posting in Slack. 

- *What is working well with this wireframe?*
- *What is one thing that could be different about this wireframe?*
- *What did you learn?*

Invite TAs to provide feedback and insights. 

Offer your own, too. 

Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about creating Android wireframes:

- Android components don't have any usability issues. False; although they try to make highly usable interface elements, be mindful of which components you are applying and why. Android has more variation in its executions as well. 
- Android users are more forgiving of UI changes. False; everyone deserves usable, useful, and consistent user experiences.

Finally, with challenge in mind, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can directly apply to their prototypes:


- Although using Material components is fun, the digitized executions are still wireframes, so don't get too carried away with adding color. 
- Do not use all the Material components just because you can. As with cooking, avoid throwing in all the spices at once and follow the recipe. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

**Help students connect the learning to the challenge:** The wireframes students worked on will prepare them for executing Part 5 of their challenge assignment—creating Android wireframes.

Now, it's time for a break.

## SLIDE 61
## 10. Break (15 min)

:bulb: Brain breaks support learning, so take time to relax, drink water, or stretch. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Don't stop sharing your screen. Put up a Google timer or a YouTube timer video to help get students back into the Zoom room on time.

Let students know that after the break, they will be spending the rest of the class working on their wireframes and prototypes!

Enjoy your break. 

## SLIDE 62
## 11. Student Do: Mid-Fidelity Mobile Prototype Activity (40 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to support students as they create iOS or Android wireframes. They'll also start building their clickable prototypes in InVision, too. 
>
> - This activity prepares students to achieve today's fourth and final learning objective: to build a clickable wireframe prototype with Adobe XD and InVision. Recommend students user their challenge prototype to maximize classtime towards their assignment.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** For a UX/UI designer, building wireframes is a fundamental skill set. Building wireframes is relevant to the industry because it will be a significant piece of your job as a UX designer. Designers become good and fast at making wireframes. 

**TAs,** slack out the following instructions and keep them open during the activity: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.2/04.2-03-Mid-Fidelity-Mobile-Prototype](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QpdmdaUeTjLYzQ70LS_yi9f6prrbAOzGQ7W7Nfwi38g/edit?usp=sharing).

### Summary

Students will work to create wireframes using either iOS or Android design guidelines. They'll export their wireframes from Figma or Adobe XD and import them into InVision. From there, they'll build a clickable prototype in InVision based on the imported wireframes. 

> **Instructor Note:** Adobe XD and Figma have clickable prototyping functionality. We are practicing using InVision because their challenge requires executing a clickable prototype with that tool. Later in the UI units, we will us Figma and Adobe XD prototyping.

**Important! Students will need to bring their finished prototype to the next class for usability testing practice.** 

### Instructions

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keep students in the main Zoom room for this activity. 

- Students will work independently. 

- Part 1: Students will choose their operating system type then digitize their wireframes.
- Part 2: Students will build prototypes from their wireframes in InVision.
- Part 3: Wrap up and share work in Slack.

The hope is that students can practice testing their challenge in class and outside the classroom this week. 

> **Instructor Note:** If students complete the activity early, encourage them to stay online and move on to the prototype section of their challenge. 

### Instructor and TAs

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Monitor students as they work and offer support where needed.:

- *Students might struggle with consistency.* Help them to use the same type sizes.

- *Students might struggle with screen titles* Help them to label each screen effectively so that when they import them to InVision, they can work faster. For example: 01-Screen-Name-v1, 02-Screen-Name-v1, etc. 

### Deliverable

Students will complete wireframes for a clickable prototype in InVision. 

## 12. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (2 min)

Bring everyone's attention back to your screen. 

Use this time to review the key concepts from the lesson. This helps to move what students learned from working memory into long-term memory.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students can raise their hands and answer aloud or use Slack to post their answers:


- What is the value of the design guidelines we studied today?
  - *Answer: We are learning about how design systems get created and scaled around the world. Using them effectively will make you more employable.*
- What is a design pattern library?
  - *Answer: A set of standards for interacting with computers.*
- What were a couple differences between iOS and Android guidelines?
  - *Answer: Colors, button styles, San Francisco type vs. Roboto typography and countless other nuances.*

> **Instructor Note:** Ask students if they have any final questions.
>
> - Invite students to stay online for office hours. 

- Thank everyone for doing their best work.
- Stay online for office hours.
