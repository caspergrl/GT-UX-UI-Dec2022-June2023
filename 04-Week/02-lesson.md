# 4.2 Lesson Plan: iOS Human Interface Guidelines and Android Material Design Guidelines

---

## Overview

Today's class will introduce students to the iOS Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and Material Design Guidelines. Students will create HIG and Material Design grayscale mockups with UI kits. They'll spend the final part of the day creating iOS or Android wireframes and prototypes for their challenge. 

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Apply the iOS HIG and/or Material Design Guidelines to your prototypes.

2. Use the HIG pattern library in Figma or Adobe XD to transform wireframes into iOS wireframe mockups.

3. Use the Material Design pattern library in Figma or Adobe XD to transform wireframes into wireframe mockups.

4. Build an iOS or Android wireframe and prototype with Figma or Adobe XD and InVision. 

## Class at a Glance

> **Instructor Note:** Today's class will be shorter than usual by design to allow time in the end for students to work on their wireframes, prototypes, and challenge. 


Today's class covers two types of design guidelines:

1. The iOS HIG design guidelines 
2. The Material Design guidelines

Today's class contains two demos:

1. A demo of iOS in Figma or Adobe XD (Section 3)
2. A demo of Material Design in Figma or Adobe XD (Section 7)

By the end of today, students will be iterating their prototypes from user testing in Lesson 4.1 and will have built—or started building—iOS/Android wireframes. They will then iterate a clickable prototype in class, which is also part of their challenge. ***Students must have their challenge prototypes ready by the next class for testing.***

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).



## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: > :globe_with_meridians:) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians:**Online class:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activity and review sections by doing the activity as a class instead of creating breakout groups.  

## Preparing for Class

- **Important:** Today, you'll prepare students to create prototypes using existing libraries and tools correctly. Before class, review the following resources on the iOS HIG and Material Guidelines:
    - [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/)
- [https://material.io/design/](https://material.io/design/)

- **Preparation tips:** read through this entire lesson plan, slides, student activity files, as well as the Time Tracker.  
  - ***Make notes*** so that you are thoroughly prepared to teach and support students.
  - ***As you lecture*** relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future careers. Look for the :gem: - Designer insight icon throughout this lesson plan, which offers an opportunity to share an anecdote from your professional experience.

**Review your lecture slides:**
    - [04-Week/01-Slides/04.2-iOS and Material Design Guidelines Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H48zAVSzaXl8MDNgX_PIXjEHdvqIqhtLdPWk2XOqLHI/edit?usp=sharing).

**Practice your demos *at least twice*:**
    - Section 3: You'll demo iOS in Figma or Adobe XD.
        - Section 7: You'll demo Material Design in Figma or Adobe XD. 

**Summarize the activity instructions out loud:**

  - Students will readily dive into the activities if you provide verbal guidance. There's no need to read the instructions word for word, but do summarize the key steps.

**Emphasize the value of challenge and keeping up with it:**

- The weekly challenge is built with class lessons in mind—each week teaches them what they need to know to complete more of the challenge. 
- challenge is where students practice what they're learning and how they prepare for future careers in design.  


- **Reminder:** Next class will be the last lesson of the UX portion of the boot camp. Next week, students will start Project 1 (project weeks 5, 6, and 7). Following that, they will move into UI (in week 8).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Objectives (2 min)

- Open and download today's slides. TAs should share them with the students via Slack: [04-Week/01-Slides/04.2-iOS Human Interface Guidelines Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H48zAVSzaXl8MDNgX_PIXjEHdvqIqhtLdPWk2XOqLHI/edit#slide=id.g619bba08c7_0_0).

**Welcome to class!**

 > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Start the class out with a quick engagement tactic to get everyone focused on the boot camp content.   

- **Say:** "Today we're studying the guidelines for designing on iOS and Android phones. This will prepare you to design the best possible wireframes during the last portion of class." 

- Connect the last class to the goals of Unit 4:
  - Our goal in this unit is for you to create ready-to-test prototypes. 
  - Last class, you studied guerrilla user testing and analysis. Next class, you will use that knowledge for running tests. In order for you to have a prototype that's appropriate for testing, you must first understand the Apple and Android device design guidelines—that's today's focus. 

- *Remind students:* They will work on their wireframes for the last 40 minutes of class and develop prototypes as part of their challenge. ***Everyone needs to have their prototypes ready by next class for user testing.*** 

- Connect the design thinking model to what you're teaching today: We are in the second diamond and practicing the cycle of ideate > prototype > test.

**Engage the class.**
  - Get everyone's energy flowing and minds ready for understanding the guidelines they'll learn about today by asking students to draw from their own experience:
    - *Question 1:* Think of a time when you referred to guidelines in order to learn how to format something, whether for school, a job, or another pursuit. What role did the guidelines play?
    - *Question 2:* When have you used guidelines to design or build something technical?

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students engage by raising their hands to speak or addressing the question via Slack. 

- Review today's learning objectives.

Now, get ready to dive into the design guidelines for Apple's human interface. 

## 2. Instructor Do: Design Guidelines and iOS HIG (20 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your first goal for this section is to familiarize students with the concept of design guidelines. Your second goal is to show students what's unique and important about Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for iOS. This lecture prepares students to achieve today's first learning objective: to apply the design guidelines. 

In the last class, students practiced user testing (guerrilla/remote moderated) and hopefully have some user testing data to make iterations. Today, they're folding in user testing iterations and moving forward with their wireframes and prototypes, which they'll test in the next class.

> **Instructor Note:** Encourage students to use their challenge prototypes to maximize the class time towards this weeks challenge.

## SLIDE 7
### Six Guerrilla User Testing Tips
1. Incentivize your testers (give/buy them something).

   - Be prepared. 
   - For example: Offer a cup of coffee. In the digital world that might look like a Starbucks gift card or a small Venmo payment. 

2. Don’t rely on the Internet.

   - Don't have blind faith that the internet will be working.
   - Have your prototype ready to go, internet-free. For example, have your solution in an analog form, printed out or as a .pdf you can click through.

3. Be prepared.

   - Make sure you have your questions ready to go!
   - Be prepared by printing out your testing plan and questions.
   - Designers should be honest about who they are, why they’re testing, and what sort of feedback they’re looking to receive. For example, "Our team is looking to validate if you find our solution valuable." Or, "We want to see if you can use our new feature." 

4. Present your design clearly.

   - Read each task aloud to your user testers.
   - Wait until the user tester has completed each task before you move onto the next step.
   - Ask your user testers to think out loud during the test.

5. Avoid crowds.

   - Super busy locations might make it hard to communicate.
   - Crowded spaces also make it harder to recruit user testers.

6. Watch the clock!

   - Be mindful of how much time you spend with each test subject and always remind them that they can leave at any point during the test.
   - The last thing you want is a grumpy user skewing your feedback.

## SLIDE 8
### Guidelines for Conducting User Tests

- User testing is not easy, and you need to be patient with your participants.

1. Give test subjects one task at a time. 
2. Let participants set the pace.
3. Let participants struggle.
4. Participants should indicate when a task is complete.
5. Remind them to think aloud. 

## SLIDE 9
### Get the Participants to Think Aloud

- It is hard to know what a user is thinking. One way to try and reveal their thought process is to model behavior and give permission to think out loud.

- Assure them you are testing the product, not their performance.

## 7. Student Do: Guerrilla User Testing/Remote Moderated User Testing Activity (45 min)

**TAs,** Slack out the instructions link for the activity: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.1/04.1-02-Guerrilla-User-Testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZugcgWwaJq-WlvcczKZl8YnsiFv19LlbL58wKF8d9k/edit?usp=sharing).

### Summary

In this activity, students are going to execute their guerrilla user testing plan by conducting user tests on classmates.

### Instructions

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Create breakout rooms for students to work in pairs. Create more breakout rooms than pairs. As students complete their user tests, you or the TAs can reassign them to another testing breakout room. Keep a pair in the main room to preserve the class recording. 

> **Instructor Note:** Participate as a user tester with your TAs. Stay in the main room to redirect students into other user tests. 

- Part 1: Student pairs will load their InVision or Figma prototype onto their mobile phones. 

- Part 2: Student pairs will begin executing their testing plans. The goal is to get students to run tests on two to three test subjects.

> **Instructor Note:** Remind students to use screen recording to capture their user tests.

### Instructor and TAs

Monitor the students as they work by visiting breakout rooms or using Slack to check in on pairs' progress.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will conduct remotely moderated user tests, so they may require more help and adjustments to get used to the online format. We suggest assigning roles with each pair. Assign who goes first. 

### Deliverable

Students will have recorded videos of test subjects and taken notes during user testing, which they'll share via Slack.

> **Instructor Note:** A break follows this activity. The activity review will occur after the break. If students need more time or want to conduct more user tests, allow them to work during the break.

## SLIDE 12
## 9. Instructor Do: Guerrilla User Testing/Remote Moderated User Testing Activity Review (10 min)

Bring the class's attention back to your screen to lead a review discussion. 

Facilitate a discussion around the issues designers can run into while conducting guerrilla user testing. Sometimes it's hard to know if you conducted a guerrilla test correctly until you've synthesized the data! 

### Hold a critique

- Remind students to share their guerrilla user testing plans in Slack.
- Prompt student input:
  - *What does a good user test look like?*
  - *How do we know we're doing a user test correctly?*
  - *What are some risks to guerrilla user testing?*

> **Instructor Note:** Invite TAs to offer their perspectives. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Briefly share your experience with synthesizing user testing data. 

- Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about guerrilla user tests:

  - Guerrilla user tests are only for amateurs or teams with no money. False; user testing should be part of your process and, as a student, you will have to use your grit versus money. Always advocate for a user testing budget in your future roles.
  - Guerrilla user tests are not respected in the industry. False; the gumption to test your ideas with users is essential to solving human-centered problems effectively. 

- Finally, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can directly apply to their testing plans:

  - Practicing with your user testing plan will improve the testing results. Don't assume your plan is perfect. After each user test execution, tweak your process.
  - Look for user testing patterns. If all your users struggled in the same place, you probably have a problem. 

**Help students connect what they just learned to their challenge:** The user testing that students practiced will help with completing Part 5 of their challenge assignment to conduct a guerrilla user test.

## SLIDE 14
### Guerrilla User Testing Process

- Effective UX/UI designers have the skill to get the most out of their testing data. 

- First, ***define user test data analysis:*** To analyze data, designers apply frameworks to testing data that help them identify meaningful patterns in the data they've gathered. Not all of the data is helpful. Designers analyze data to get at the meaningful information.

- Let's discuss the final **Step 6: Review findings and suggest improvements**.

**Airbnb Case Study:** Let's go back to our Airbnb Case Study. The last step in the guerrilla user testing process is analysis. We can break down the analysis into a few key steps.

## SLIDE 15
### Review Findings and Suggested Improvements

For example, we might plot our research data and group user feedback into an affinity diagram. 

   - Some data is sorted by the level of frequency of certain types of comments. 

**Prioritize feedback:** After making an affinity diagram, prioritize the issues based on how important you expect them to be to users. 

   - Sometimes we prioritize based on how important the issues are to users and Airbnb's bottom line.

## SLIDE 16
### Example 1: Write up suggested improvements.

- **Write up your findings and add suggested improvements:** There is confusion around the search button. People rarely realize that there is a filter option.

- Recommendation: Iterate the search bar and replace it with a different icon. Iterate the filter button to include a search option. Change the color of the filter button so that it has higher visibility.

## SLIDE 17
### Example 2: Add suggested improvements.

Users found the reviews confusing (who reviewed what experience and what is the rating?).

- Recommendation: Iterate the reviews page to show individual ratings.

## SLIDE 18
### Example 3: Add suggested recommendations.

Here, we see a different card UI for house listings; however, there is an inconsistency on the site with the use of Airbnb's wish list icon.

- Recommendation: When the user hovers over the heart icon, a label should indicate its function, reducing the number of clicks to save a rental to a wish list.

> **Instructor Note:** Check in with students — "Are there any questions about what we just covered?"

## SLIDE 19
### Example 4: Implement recommendations.

Here, we see a different card UI for house listings; however, there is an inconsistency on the site with the use of Airbnb's wish list icon and share icon.

- Recommendation: Including labels with both features, reducing the number of clicks to save a location.

## SLIDE 20
### Example 5: Building consistency across your UI system.

As designers, it's essential to understand how to present your research to teammates, stakeholders, executives, and clients.

- Research is used to make informed business decisions.

- Knowing your users' needs means you can design a product with value.

## 11. Student Do: Guerrilla User Testing/Remote Moderated User Testing Analysis Activity (20 min)

**TAs,** Slack out the instructions link to the activity: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.1/04.1-03-Guerrilla-Testing-Analysis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10EOQmB-FAN1oteEfNOn6DJD6xDuknzNtNqtOQGBxAHw).

For students who want to take things further, share the design brief template so that they can practice sharing their research process: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.1-03-UX-Design-Brief-Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NYa7AhUiN-Y9aFFi0HnpKjNyqzGxTznF0_GPsZ2bZDg/edit).

**Summary**

Students will analyze their guerrilla user testing results by using sticky notes to extract ideas and then organize them—the methodology used by designers in the real world.

**Instructions**

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keep everyone in the main Zoom room. 

- Students will work independently in Miro.
- First, students will study the videos they took of their user tests as well as the notes they took. 
- Then, they'll write that feedback down on sticky notes. 
- Next, they'll organize those notes into an affinity diagram and then into a prioritization matrix. 
- Finally, they'll write down their findings.

**Instructor and TAs** 

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Monitor students as they work and offer support to students who seem to get stuck. Encourage students to use Slack for questions or raise their hands for support. 

If students get stuck on the activity task of pulling out user testing issues, help them by showing them how to refer back to their guerrilla user tests. 

  - Ask some questions: 
     - Did your plan work out? 
     - What didn't work with your user tests?
     - What did you see, and what did you hear?

If students struggle to come up with ideas to write down on their sticky notes, suggest that they refer back to their prototypes or videos of their user tests. 

**Deliverable**

Students will produce an affinity diagram, prioritization matrix, and written findings based on their guerrilla user test data in this activity. They will share their work in Slack.

## SLIDE 23
## 12. Instructor Do: Guerrilla User Testing/Remote Moderated User Testing Analysis Activity Review (10 min)

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Bring everyone's attention back to your screen in order to lead a review of the activity. 

**Hold a critique.**

- Remind students to post their feedback diagrams and/or priority matrices into Slack. 
- Scroll through Slack and choose work to critique.
- Aim to critique two to three students' testing analyses.
  - ***Prompt student input:***
    - *What do you like about this analysis?*
    - *What did you learn?*
    - *What would you do differently?*
  - ***Ask TAs to share insights:***
    - Share what you liked and what you would do differently.

>  :gem: **Designer Insight:** Students would love to hear about your first guerrilla tests. Instructor and TAs, share a brief story about analyzing the results and lessons learned. 
>
> - If you're short on time, entice students to stay online for office hours to hear your testing stories from the real world of design. 

- Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about how to analyze guerrilla user tests:

  - User tests should reveal all of your issues. False; user testing is a continuous process. Don't just test once and call it done. Test every iteration. 
  - User testing analysis is very time consuming. False but true; the design process is the long game but continually doing user testing can shorten the analysis time. 

- Finally, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can directly apply to their future analyses:

  - Document both things that went well and things that went poorly. Use different color sticky notes for each. 
  - Use technology to capture and share your user testing analysis.

> **Instructor Note:** Take any student questions that remain. 
>
> - Students can stay online for office hours to ask questions about the lesson or this week's challenge.


**Help students connect what they just learned to their challenge:** The testing analyses students just completed will prepare them for Part 3 of their challenge assignment—spending one to two hours analyzing and prioritizing the results of their guerrilla user testing.

And, now, it's time to introduce this week's challenge! Then you can wrap up today's class.

- **iOS components**

    - Views, controls, and bars allow app developers to build iOS interfaces quickly.

The goal in designing scalable products is to consider all your users. Usability and accessibility play huge roles in making scalable design.

- **Vision and contrast:** Vision impairments include blindness, color blindness, all forms of vision loss, and challenges and situations that make seeing the screen uncomfortable or difficult.
- **Hearing and audio:** Hearing impairments include all types of hearing loss and situations in which people don't want their devices to make noise, such as when they're in a theater.
- **Physical and motor:** Apple provides several accommodations to help people use their devices without the need for fine motor control.
- **Literacy and Learning:** Literacy and learning challenges include difficulty speaking and reading, managing complexity, and staying focused.

**Modality:**

- Use modality to create focus.
- Prevent people from doing other things until they complete a task or dismiss a message or view.

## SLIDE 41
**Ask for permission:**

- People expect to have control over their private data. In iOS, users must grant permission for an app to access personal information, including photos and contact information.
- **Ask,** "Why do we need to ask individual permissions from our users to access their content?" 

  - For example, multiple international and domestic laws require that these permissions be requested (such as the EU's Data Protection Directive and ePrivacy Directive and California's COPPA) and that Apple requires them if you want the app to be available in the Apple App Store.

**iOS HIG - Eight Best Practices**

Let's talk about the best practices for applying the iOS guidelines to our designs.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Choose one to two of the following as the basis for an anecdote while you are lecturing. This will help students connect what they're learning to the real world. 

1. **Treat typography as content.**

   - Make your type legible and give your type a clear hierarchy.

## SLIDE 45
2. **Make text readable.**

   - Use at least 11 point size, so it's legible at a regular viewing distance.
   - We'll cover more in the UI units.

## SLIDE 46
3. **Use appropriate font sizes.**

   - Type is for reading, so make sure it is legible.

## SLIDE 47
4. **Use large titles.**

   - Bold fonts are everywhere in iOS 13.
   - Titles are now big and black.
   - Since screens are about twice as tall as they were with previous iPhones, it only makes sense to have large titles. Another reason for large fonts is accessibility.
   - With millions of people of all ages using their phones daily, making the content as clear and readable as possible is essential.

## SLIDE 48
5. **Focus on alignment.**

   - Grids are essential in maintaining consistent alignment.

## SLIDE 49
6. **Organization matters.**

   - Content should be ordered and clear.

## SLIDE 50
7. **Consider tap targets.**

   - Make a point of 44x44 pixels.

## SLIDE 51
8. **Use a prominent color for touchable areas.**

   - The user should clearly understand what they can interact with.

- When designing apps for the iPhone X, you have to be aware of the safe zone and layout margins. The safe zone ensures your app UI doesn’t get clipped by the device’s sensors or corners.

**TAs,** slack out the following for students to review at home: 

- [https://designcode.io/ios11-iphone-x](https://designcode.io/ios11-iphone-x)

- [https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/)

- [https://icons8.com/ios](https://icons8.com/ios)

- [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls)

- [https://creativemarket.com/icon54/83095-2080-Icons-for-iOS-Android-Apps](https://creativemarket.com/icon54/83095-2080-Icons-for-iOS-Android-Apps)

Building on these iOS design guidelines, you'll demo Apple's resources for iOS designers.

## SLIDES 55-56
## 3. Instructor Do: Demo - iOS in Figma or Adobe XD (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal for this section is to give a demo using iOS resources to help students feel comfortable using the tools themselves.

Here, you'll introduce students to the iOS resources, then provide time to practice using and iterating with the tools.

**Remind students:** They'll continue to learn these tools over time. You'll share more resources to improve their wireframing skills. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Demo Figma for online classes.

- To demo Figma, go to: [https://www.figma.com/community/file/829177623045431222](https://www.figma.com/community/file/829177623045431222). Duplicate the community resource. 

  - **TAs:** share the Figma resource in Slack.

If demoing Adobe XD, go to the design resource and download the iOS Adobe XD file: [https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/).

- **TAs**, share the Adobe XD resource in Slack.

### Set up your demo.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Navigate away from the slideshow for this demonstration. If you shared your entire desktop, make sure to open your files on that shared desktop. If you shared a single window, be sure to re-share your screen to capture the appropriate window or desktop.

- Remember to narrate what you are doing during transitions and demonstrations. In this instance, you might say: “I’m now going to switch from the slideshow to another tab so I can demonstrate a task.”

Since you’ll be sharing your screen for this demonstration, ask students to use the raise hands feature on Zoom to ask questions. At a good breaking point, call on a specific student to unmute and ask their question. Alternatively, you can ask students to share their questions in the Zoom chat and have the TA provide answers in the chat.

- Ask a TA to set a timer for 10 minutes to track your time. 

- Don't go over time; you can share more with students after class wraps up, during office hours, if needed.


**Windows students:** Students using Windows will not be able to download the library from the Apple website. Slack out this link containing the Adobe XD files for Windows students to use: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.2/XD iOS Library Resources/Windows](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1fnTiRSUv8ctwoGSNMERxiZziyycxHN7Y). ![Apple iOS](Images/iOS.png)

### Start your demo.

Walk through the following steps for students:

Part 1: Review Resource 

1. Download iOS Figma/Adobe XD resources.

2. Open the Figma/Adobe XD file "UIElements+DesignTemplates+Guides-iPhone8."

3. Explore the components supplied in the file from Apple.

   - Many Apple designers want to share their knowledge.

   - We can build apps faster because of these shared design languages and UI components.

   - **If it feels like cheating, it is not! We should maximize the resources provided.**

4. Review the iOS symbols and the design library supplied in the Figma or Adobe XD resource.

Part 2: Wireframe a Login Screen

> **Instructor Note:** Make sure to vocalize your actions using the software and remind students they will practice next and should continue at home.


1. Create a New Artboard for the mobile iPhone 8 or 10.

2. Relabel the screen "01-Homepage-Login"

3. Add a mobile grid - 4 columns.

4. Create a text box to the left of the screen and add an outline for a login page element requirements.

5. Build a quick wireframe for a login screen using the iOS resources.

   - Add components top down. If you want to make an outline or talk through what is required on a login page first, that will help students. 

   - Make sure to group elements and relabel them in your layers/assets panel.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for any questions. 

***You won't "run out" of time:***  Don't worry about "finishing" your demo. If students need to see parts of your demo again while they work, you can show them during the activity. 

Students should be very eager at this point to practice wireframing, the next activity. Turn them loose.

## SLIDE 57
Questions??

## SLIDE 58
## 4. Student Do: iOS Wireframes Activity (25 min)

**TAs,** slack out the instructions and the iOS Design Guidelines Cheat Sheet: 

- Activity instructions: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.2/04.2-01-iOS-Wireframes-Activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBEpePGENhpDsj1hedh8yq0KjoiW0KEnkQZvaT7tSQE/edit?usp=sharing)

- iOS Design Guidelines Cheat Sheet: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.2/04.2-02-iOS-Guidelines-Cheat-Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PL2mey03hLMm3kEqEI7cq68ktZgg71JdBqUwTpxsfLs/edit#)

> **Instructor Note:** This activity gives students an opportunity to meet today's second learning objective, use the HIG pattern library for iOS in Figma or Adobe XD. Recommend students use their challenge Prototype to maximize classtime towards their challenge.


> 💼**Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, using the HIG pattern library is relevant to the industry because you might want to get a UX job working on iOS applications. 

### Summary

Students will practice taking a digital wireframe and transforming it into an iOS wireframe, which should follow the developer guidelines and design patterns for iOS.

### Instructions

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keep students in the main Zoom room for this activity. If they need to see portions of the demo again, you can show it by sharing your screen. 

- Students will work independently.
- Part 1: Students will download and familiarize themselves with the iOS Library from Figma or Adobe XD Resources. 
- Part 2: Students will digitize their wireframes to be compatible with iOS guidelines. Students can use a digital wireframe from their challenge or the previous class activity.
- Part 3: Wrap up and post work to Slack! 

### Instructor and TAs

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students may struggle to recall certain portions of your demo, so be prepared to share your screen and go over certain demo portions again. Students who need help will watch your screen, and students who don't will stay focused on their work.

*Possible trouble spots to watch out for and how to remediate*:

- Students might struggle to add elements, so help them to use copy and paste or hold down Option to create a copy.
- Students might struggle to align items, so help them to use a grid and use the align/distribute tools.

### Deliverable

Students will create two to three iOS wireframes in Figma or Adobe XD and post their work to Slack.

## SLIDE 59
## 5. Instructor Do: iOS Wireframes Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention and lead a review of the activity. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have the TAs help students who haven't finished their wireframes via Slack or by creating a breakout room.

### Hold critique.

- Scroll through the work posted in Slack and choose the first set of wireframes to review.
- Aim to review two to three sets of iOS wireframes with the class. 

### Questions to stimulate conversation:

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Invite students to participate by raising their hands to speak or by posting in Slack. 

- *What is working well with this wireframe?*
- *What is one thing that could be different about this wireframe?*
- *What did you learn from this wireframe?*

Invite TAs to provide feedback and insights. 

Offer your own, too. 

Now, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about creating iOS wireframes:

- iOS components don't have any usability issues. False: although they try to make highly usable interface elements, be mindful of which components you are applying and why.
- iOS components don't apply to apps on the iOS platform. True and false: Apple can reject applications from their platform if they don't reach a level of quality in the interface. Applying iOS best practices in your executions can help assure your solutions don't get rejected. 

Finally, with the challenge in mind, share a couple of actionable, tactical tips that students can directly apply to their prototypes:

- Although using iOS components is fun, the digitized executions are still wireframes, so don't get too carried away with adding color. 
- Do not use all the components just because you can. As with cooking, avoid throwing in all the spices at once and follow the recipe. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

**Help students connect the learning to the challenge:** The wireframes students worked on will prepare them for executing Part 5 of their challenge assignment—creating iOS wireframes.

### What Is Material Design?

Material Design is a design language developed by Google to provide continuity across its web and mobile products. Just like its name, it was inspired by real materials and combined them into one design system to create a sleek, intuitive, beautiful, and interactive UX.

> 💼 **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, reading and understanding *a variety of operating systems' design guidelines* is relevant to the industry because many of you might go work on applications that are on Android. Or even go work for Google.

### Why Does Material Design Matter?

Material Design provides a uniformity of experience that Google products have been lacking. Its mobile-centric focus also represents an important shift in the company's approach to design.

**TAs,** slack out these Material Design resources, which students can refer to during their next activity: 

- YouTube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrT6v5sOwJg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrT6v5sOwJg)

- Material Design awards: [https://www.cssdesignawards.com/website-gallery?feature=material+design](https://www.cssdesignawards.com/website-gallery?feature=material+design)

- Material Design don'ts: [https://blog.prototypr.io/common-material-design-bad-practices-to-avoid-b7995f251329](https://blog.prototypr.io/common-material-design-bad-practices-to-avoid-b7995f251329)

## SLIDE 63
Review

## SLIDE 64
Three main principles construct Material Design: 

1. Material is the metaphor. The development of the material was inspired by the study of tactile elements we use every day, such as paper and ink. It makes the object light, and the surface and movements are better when interacting with each other.

2. Make designs bold, graphic, and intentional. Typography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery used in the print-based design makes the content better. 

3. Motion provides meaning. This is one of the most noted things. In material, you should have meaningful and appropriate motion, subtle and clear feedback, as well as efficient and coherent transition.


## SLIDE 65
### Material Design Principles Are Rooted in Reality

Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows. Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink as digital objects.

![Material 3D](Images/material-3d.png)

- The material environment is a three-dimensional space, which means all objects have x, y, and z dimensions.

## SLIDE 66
### Elevation and Shadow Concept

In Material Design, we're trying to mimic the concept of picking up a piece of paper, which would generate a shadow on a table's surface, for instance.  The elevation is the relative distance between two surfaces along the z-axis.

**Elevation**

All Material Design surfaces and components have elevation values. Surfaces at different elevations do the following:

- Allow surfaces to move in front of and behind other surfaces, such as content scrolling behind app bars.
- Reflect spatial relationships, such as how a floating action button’s shadow indicates it is separate from a card collection.


- **TAs please Slack out** Read more about elevation here: [https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html).

## SLIDE 67
**Shadow**

Material surfaces cast shadows when they obstruct light sources. The consistent use of shadow depicts the elevation. Shadows express the degree of height between surfaces and should be used consistently across a product.

- The basic material surface is opaque white, with 1dp thickness, and casts a shadow. All UI elements in Material Design result from modifications to this surface.

- Read more about light and shadow here: [https://material.io/design/environment/light-shadows.html#light](https://material.io/design/environment/light-shadows.html#light).

## SLIDE 68
Review

## SLIDE 69
Material Design has three-dimensional qualities reflected in its use of surfaces, depth, and shadows. For example, shadows provide useful cues about an object’s direction of movement and whether the distance between surfaces increases or decreases.

Example 1:
- DON'T: Without a shadow to indicate elevation, it’s unclear whether this square is increasing in size or increasing its elevation.
- DO: Use consistent shadow to help the user understand that the object is changing shape as opposed to changing elevation.

## SLIDE 70
Example 2:

- DO: Use shadows to make differences in surface elevation perceptible. The smaller, sharper shadow of the app bar (1) indicates it is at a lower elevation than the menu (2).
- DON'T: The lack of shadows or other visual cues to indicate edges and surface overlap creates insufficient contrast between surfaces.

Example 3:

- DO: Use a translucent background to indicate surface overlap, but not the degree of elevation.
- DON'T: The lack of shadows or scrimmed background makes it difficult to distinguish the background's dialog box.
![Shadow button](Images/shadow-btn.png)


## SLIDE 71
For example, we can notice how shadows are used to convey the state of a button:

- Normal has a small shadow to indicate that it is a button.
- Pressed has a larger shadow to indicate that something has changed.

## SLIDE 72
We see this same type of relationship with cards.

## SLIDE 73
### Material Design Surface Positioning and Movement

Surfaces, aka UI components, can remain fixed on the x- and y-axes or can be moveable in any direction. Review the examples:

A. The top app bar (1) remains in a fixed position while the card collection scrolls only vertically behind it.
B. Surfaces can move independently of each other.
C. Surfaces (1) can move in any direction, although movement can be confined to a single axis at a time.

## SLIDE 74
### Material Design Navigation Patterns

Like iOS, Material Design has many UI patterns. Like iOS, material has a bottom button tab. They also encourage the use of tabs for top navigation as well.

## SLIDE 75
**Reverse Navigation**

Reverse navigation refers to backward movement between screens. It can move users chronologically through their recent screen history, or upward through an app’s hierarchy. Unlike iOS, Android uses a back button on the bottom bar.

## SLIDE 76
- Like iOS, upward navigation-when navigation icons are at the top of the screen-are possible as well.

## 7. Instructor Do: Demo - Material Design in Figma or Adobe XD (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal for this section is to demo using Material Design resources so that students feel confident in the activity that follows.

First, you'll introduce students to the iOS resources. Then you'll allow them time to practice using and iterating with their tools.

**Remind students:** Learning these tools takes time. While you'll share more resources to improve students' wireframing skills, they should be practicing at home. 

### Set up the demo.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Ask a TA to set a timer for 10 minutes to track your time. 

- Don't go over time; you can share more with students after class wraps up, during office hours, if needed.

> **Instructor Note:** If you demoed Figma with iOS, stick with Figma and vice versa.

**Demoing Figma:** Go to and duplicate the Material Baseline Design Kit. [https://www.figma.com/community/file/778763161265841481](https://www.figma.com/community/file/778763161265841481)

[https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/resources.html](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/resources.html)

- Click UI Kits.

 ![Material Design](Images/material.png)

### Give the demo.

Walk through the following steps for students:

### Demo Part 1: Review

1. Download Material Design Figma or Adobe XD resources.

2. Open Figma or Adobe XD file "xd-resource-material-design.xd."

3. Explore the components supplied in the file from Adobe.

   - We can build apps faster because of these shared design languages.

   - **If it feels like cheating, it is not! We should maximize the resources provided.**

4. Review the Android symbols and the design library supplied in the Figma or Adobe XD resource.

**Demo Part 2: Material Wireframe**

1. Create a new artboard for the mobile iPhone 8 or 10.

2. Build a quick wireframe for a login screen using Android resources.

Again, don't worry about "finishing" the demo. 

***Remember:*** If students need to see parts of your demo again while they work, feel free to show them. 

Students should be very eager at this point to get hands-on and jump into wireframing. That's next!

> - This activity prepares students to achieve today's fourth and final learning objective: to build a clickable wireframe prototype with Adobe XD and InVision. Recommend students user their challenge prototype to maximize classtime towards their assignment.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** For a UX/UI designer, building wireframes is a fundamental skill set. Building wireframes is relevant to the industry because it will be a significant piece of your job as a UX designer. Designers become good and fast at making wireframes. 

**TAs,** slack out the following instructions and keep them open during the activity: [04-Week/02-Activities/04.2/04.2-03-Mid-Fidelity-Mobile-Prototype](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QpdmdaUeTjLYzQ70LS_yi9f6prrbAOzGQ7W7Nfwi38g/edit?usp=sharing).

### Summary

Students will work to create wireframes using either iOS or Android design guidelines. They'll export their wireframes from Figma or Adobe XD and import them into InVision. From there, they'll build a clickable prototype in InVision based on the imported wireframes. 

> **Instructor Note:** Adobe XD and Figma have clickable prototyping functionality. We are practicing using InVision because their challenge requires executing a clickable prototype with that tool. Later in the UI units, we will us Figma and Adobe XD prototyping.

**Important! Students will need to bring their finished prototype to the next class for usability testing practice.** 

### Instructions

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Keep students in the main Zoom room for this activity. 

- Students will work independently. 

- Part 1: Students will choose their operating system type then digitize their wireframes.
- Part 2: Students will build prototypes from their wireframes in InVision.
- Part 3: Wrap up and share work in Slack.

The hope is that students can practice testing their challenge in class and outside the classroom this week. 

> **Instructor Note:** If students complete the activity early, encourage them to stay online and move on to the prototype section of their challenge. 

### Instructor and TAs

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Monitor students as they work and offer support where needed.:

- *Students might struggle with consistency.* Help them to use the same type sizes.

- *Students might struggle with screen titles* Help them to label each screen effectively so that when they import them to InVision, they can work faster. For example: 01-Screen-Name-v1, 02-Screen-Name-v1, etc. 

### Deliverable

Students will complete wireframes for a clickable prototype in InVision. 

## 12. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (2 min)

Bring everyone's attention back to your screen. 

Use this time to review the key concepts from the lesson. This helps to move what students learned from working memory into long-term memory.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students can raise their hands and answer aloud or use Slack to post their answers:


- What is the value of the design guidelines we studied today?
  - *Answer: We are learning about how design systems get created and scaled around the world. Using them effectively will make you more employable.*
- What is a design pattern library?
  - *Answer: A set of standards for interacting with computers.*
- What were a couple differences between iOS and Android guidelines?
  - *Answer: Colors, button styles, San Francisco type vs. Roboto typography and countless other nuances.*

> **Instructor Note:** Ask students if they have any final questions.
>
> - Invite students to stay online for office hours.
