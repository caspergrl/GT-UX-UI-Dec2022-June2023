# 11.1 Lesson Plan: Responsive Web Design and UI Testing

---

## Overview

In today's class, students will build on their user interface (UI) skills by creating responsive webpage prototypes and analyzing them with usability user tests.

In lessons 11.2 and 11.3, students will delve into new aspects of responsive web design (RWD), including: handling imagery, A/B testing, and building versions of homepages for group A/B testing. As a whole, Unit 11 enables students to deepen their responsive UI design skills through designing high-fidelity RWD prototypes for testing and rapid iteration.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Explain the value of RWD and its influence on webpage layouts.

2. Apply a 12-column fluid grid that uses flexible content.

3. Execute a navigation solution for mobile using responsive design.

4. Redesign and perform a usability test for a responsive homepage using an Adobe XD UI library or Figma UI Kit.

## Class at a Glance

- Welcome to Lesson 11.1 on RWD and UI testing.

- Today's class teaches RWD and how to create and test responsive webpage prototypes. The class is divided into four parts:

  - Part 1 will introduce RWD layouts.
    - *This includes a responsive website demo.*
  - Part 2 will cover fluid grids (12 columns).
  - Part 3 will teach responsive components and RWD navigation for Adobe XD or Figma.
  - Part 4 will provide students with practice designing a unique responsive homepage and testing it with classmates.

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: 🌐) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activity and review sections by doing each activity together as a class instead of creating breakout groups. 

>  **Instructor Note:** If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Prepare for Class

Review the slides for today: [11-Week/01-Slides/11.1 Responsive Web Design and UI Testing Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bIDtvEn-4i0QYN3JuVIMfqnGYi_XVMtAtSiTq5KnUtM).

For this lesson, students will need your enthusiasm to stay motivated. Think ahead and prepare to make every effort to keep the energy high.

**Today is activity heavy.**
- Be sure to review the four activities for today: [11-Week/02-Activities/11.1](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1o9wJV5WyKS5MWASHkoXLSV0qVQQMhBg9).


**Students will navigate a three-part challenge, which spans an hour.**
- That's a long stretch of time, so prepare yourself and your TAs for popping into Zoom breakout rooms to see how students are progressing and cheer them on.

**This lesson has one formal demo:**
- In Section 3, you will demonstrate the RWD of a website.

**Prepare students to have multiple devices on-hand:**
- If they have a tablet, students should have it ready for class. We want them to view the responsive site on their phone, laptops, *and* a tablet, if possible.

## Office Hours: Reviews and Practice (45 min before class)

Encourage your students to make the most out of class and not to be afraid to ask questions. Do your part by engaging students.

---

## 1. Instructor: Introduction and Objectives (5 min)

- Open up the slides for the lecture: [11-Week/01-Slides/11.1 Responsive Web Design and UI Testing Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bIDtvEn-4i0QYN3JuVIMfqnGYi_XVMtAtSiTq5KnUtM).

  - **TAs:** Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.

- Remind students: UI design will continue to get harder; it's essential to practice at home.

**Welcome the class and connect the learning.**

- Start by connecting today's lesson about RWD and testing to what students learned in the UX portion of the class. Show them the thread that runs through everything they're learning and how they're building on their existing knowledge. For example:
  - During UX, we concentrated on solving our users' needs by considering their user scenario and context. Today we will deepen our user-centered focus by improving our ability to solve UI executions across multiple responsive screens (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
  - During the design thinking process in UX, we discussed the value of ideation > prototyping > testing in an iterative process that refines our solutions over time. Today, we will double down on that practice with our UI solutions.

>:gem: **Student Insights:** Ask two or three students to briefly share any experience they've had with RWD.
>
>- Alternatively, a TA can share whether they've designed responsive websites for clients, but don't get into definitions of RWD—that's coming up next.

**Review the learning objectives.**

- Review today's objectives with the class.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for any questions before diving into the day.

## 2. Instructor Do: RWD (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to help students internalize RWD and think about multiple screen states. This ties into the day's first learning objective, understanding the value of RWD and how it influences webpage layouts.

You'll start by defining RWD and walking through examples of responsive elements and websites.

## SLIDES 1-4
Review

## SLIDE 5
Responsive web design (RWD) is web design that transforms how sites are displayed from one screen size to another (think smartphone vs. smartwatch vs. tablet, etc.). When a site is designed with RWD, no matter what size device a user looks at, it will deliver a good user experience.


## SLIDE 6
**What is RWD?**

RWD uses HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website to make it look good on all devices. 

**When do designers use RWD?**

- Designing and developing a website.
- Making decisions about layout, structure, and content hierarchy across multiple screens.
- Great for exploring functionality, and usability before dedicating time and resources to visual design and development.

**Why do we use RWD?**

- Website design systems can be large and hard to design. RWD allows us to reach a wide range of users. 
- RWD logic is about designing and developing faster and defining RWD rules that are clear to communicate to developers. 


## SLIDE 7
### Responsive Web Design

Mobile devices are dominating how users consume information on the web. Unfortunately, many of the sites and pages online were not designed for today's mobile devices. Small screens require a different approach to the content layout so that users don't have to scroll through stacked content. Today's designers must figure out how to design for smaller screens and work within size constraints.

- **How does RWD work?** RWD responds to the user's needs and their devices through scaling, reordering, and flowing content as the screen size changes.
- *Example:* A phone would show content in a single column, whereas a tablet might show it in two columns, and a desktop might show it in three columns.
- **Screen size varies:** Designers cope with a multitude of screen sizes across phones, tablets, desktops, game consoles, TVs, and even wearables. RWD is about how designers adapt webpages to any screen size, today and in the future.

## SLIDE 8
- **Ethan Marcotte:** In the webzine A List Apart, web designer, speaker, and author Ethan Marcotte wrote about RWD. We recommend you read the article and add it to your UX/UI library:

- **TAs:** Slack out the following into the #resource channel for students to read at home:
  - [https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/)
  - [https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design](https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design)

## SLIDE 9
RWD's goal is to improve the usability and accessibility of webpages through designing experiences that work across multiple screen sizes.

## SLIDE 10
Review

## SLIDE 11
🔑 **Key Tech Note:** Responsive sites use fluid grids. We size all page elements by relative units like proportion (%) or em and Root em (em/rem), rather than pixels.

- Design elements on a responsive page respond and change based on the screen size.

  - *For example*: In a three-column layout, for example, column one should take up half the page, column two should take up 30%, and column three should take up 20%. No matter the screen width, the column proportions will respond to those relative measurements.

## SLIDE 12
Review

## SLIDE 13
### Demand for Mobile Web Traffic
Mobile use has increased over time. More than half of all website traffic happens via mobile devices. This has driven the need for both RWD and adaptive layouts.

### RWD and Adaptive Layouts

Responsive design is smooth because the layout fluidly adjusts regardless of what device it is viewed on. Adaptive design, on the other hand, snaps into place because the page is serving something different because of the browser or device it is viewed on.

- **TAs:** Slack out the following into the #resource channel for students to review at home:

  - [https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-responsive-and-adaptive-design/](https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-responsive-and-adaptive-design/)

### Interaction Design Paradigms: Mouse Vs. Touchscreen

When designing for mobile devices, consider the differences between using a mouse versus using touch.

  - *Example*: On desktop computers, the user typically has a mouse to navigate and select items. On a smartphone or tablet, the user normally uses fingers to touch the screen.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, you will likely be working on modern web design projects. Your ability to demonstrate your skills and understand the RWD technology that enables solutions across screens will help you secure work. These skills should be included in your resume and added to your LinkedIn skills profile.

### RWD and Mobile First Design

The mobile first approach starts with designing the hardest, smallest screen first. Once the mobile design questions are answered, designing for other devices will be a more comfortable experience. What it boils down to is that the smallest of the designs will have only the essential features, so right away, you have designed the heart of your UX.

### Mobile First Design Applies Progressive Enhancement

Progressive enhancement is a web design strategy that emphasizes "core webpage content" designed first on the smallest screen. Progressive enhancement focuses on the content. Mobile design is tackled first because it is the hardest.

- If your site is "right" on a mobile device, it translates better to all devices.
  - For example, only supporting features that work on all screens as a modal carousel is harder to pull off on a mobile size.
  - More important, though, is that mobile first is a content-first approach. Mobile has the most limitations—screen size and bandwidth, to name a couple—and so designing within these parameters forces you to prioritize content ruthlessly.
- The mobile first approach organically leads to a design that’s more content-focused and, therefore, user-focused. The heart of the site is content—that’s what users are there for.

Now that students understand the purpose of RWD, show them a responsive website, and demonstrate precisely what makes it responsive.

## 3. Instructor Do: Demo - Responsive Website (5 min)

Now you are going to share your screen and give a demo of a responsive website for the class. Two options for what site to demo:

1. You may demo the example vice.com URL below, or
2. Ask three random students to put their favorite website URL into the #_in_class_chat Slack channel and have the rest of the students vote on a favorite website through Slack reactions—and demo that one.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: You'll want to keep the students engaged as you move through the RWD demo, so try the following:

- As you demo, ask them to share what they are noticing about the website.
  - Nominate a student to share their screen and the website. Coach them to slowly drag their browser width down in size or to use the Chrome dev inspect tools.
  - Have the TAs "interrupt" you to point out the important elements they see and connect them to responsive design.

**Instructions**

You prepared students in advance by asking them to have devices of different sizes ready for today's class. Now it's time for them to use their devices:

- Ask students to navigate to [https://www.vice.com/en_us](https://www.vice.com/en_us) (or the site everyone voted on) on as many devices as they can:
  - Mobile, tablet, and laptop
- Meanwhile, on your own computer, launch [https://www.vice.com/en_us](https://www.vice.com/en_us).
  - Test the responsive layout by dragging the browser's width in or by using the Chrome Inspect developer tools.

**Start the RWD demo.**

As you demonstrate how the site displays differently on the various screen sizes, invite students to point out what they notice. Alternatively, TAs can get things rolling by pointing out what they see.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Take a couple minutes to turn the demo over to a student! Choose a student to demo the website's responsive features, making sure that they share their screen. From there, they can use the Chrome Inspect feature to display the website in mobile, tablet, and desktop views for their classmates.

**Questions for Discussion**

- What difference do you notice right away between desktop and mobile?
- What are the other differences?
- What about the tablet (if available)?
- What is similar across the different displays?
- Do you agree with the design choices in terms of what was kept and what was changed across the different displays?

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Ask these questions yourself or employ the Zoom poll feature to stimulate discussion.

 - Zoom poll feature [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings)

Now that students have contemplated the design decisions of a webpage across display sizes, it's time to discuss a few final, important RWD tips.

The following tips will prepare students for their own hands-on RWD work.

## 4. Instructor Do: Five Responsive Grid Best Practices (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to walk through the five responsive design tips to prepare students to design their own responsive layouts. This short lecture supports the second of today's learning objectives, which is for students to apply a 12-column fluid grid that uses flexible content.

Start by emphasizing the importance of building responsive grids as a designer in the real world.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note**: As a UX/UI designer, you will use responsive grids for the remainder of you careers. To improve your chances of being hired, display your knowledge of fluid 12-column grids and UI component design in your portfolio. Add expert in the 12-column fluid grid to your resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

### RWD Best Practices

Review the five RWD best practices for designing responsive layouts:

1. Design mobile first.
2. Use four-column and 12-column grids.
3. Optimize UI grids for mobile.
4. Frame important objectives.
5. Pay attention to horizontal and vertical spacing.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to briefly share how they remember best practices like these when they are working on a RWD project.

> **Instructor Note:** Ask one or two students to share how they set themselves up for success in terms of checklists, tips, and notes. Do they keep them in a notebook, sticky notes next to their computer monitor, etc.?

Now, at last, students are ready to work with RWD layouts.

## 5. Student Do: RWD Layout Challenge Activity (20 min)

**TAs:** Slack out the following Google Doc activity and templates needed for this activity:

- [11-Week/02-Activities/11.1/11.1-01-RWD-Layout-Challenge-Activity Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vA8qGDi_omBls7i92k2suU8O0bcJRGuhszge39ps_No/edit?usp=sharing)

- [11-Week/02-Activities/11.1/11.1-01.1-Responsive-Layout-Challenge-Start.xd File](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sP9fB_yXDMZ1QOV9e1kGpKNQoAM7C8J_)

- [RWD-Layout-Challenge-Figma-Resource](https://www.figma.com/file/FYUzBpkxB1yAde5zJKn7K6/11.1-RWD-Layout-Challenge)

**Summary**

In this challenge activity, students will apply the various skills they've acquired during the UI section of the boot camp. Specifically, students will create RWD layouts that challenge their ability to quickly lay out a system of screens.

*For students who struggle*: With your TAs, encourage students to use Slack to get your attention. Have students start with a 12-column grid.

*For students who finish early*: If students already completed Part 3 of the challenge, have them navigate to [https://www.Etsy.com](https://www.Etsy.com) to discuss the solution.

**Instructions**

First, students will work independently, experimenting and designing RWD layouts.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will work on this independently; have everyone share their screens in Zoom so that you and the TAs can move from student to student and spotlight the work of individual students. Students using Figma will need to rebuild their screen sizes and grids as practice. 

**Instructor and TAs**

Monitor students and offer assistance. They might need help reordering their responsive content from desktop to mobile.

**Deliverable**

Students will post the RWD challenge solutions to Slack that show their ability to scale between screens.

## 6. Instructor Do: RWD Layout Challenge Activity Review (10 min)

**Instructor:** Download the solution file for the layout challenge: [11-Week/05-Instructor Resources/11.1-solution-files](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WyLEkKIzIPbYORFigzSYA1wsu4en12Z2).

Have students return to the main Zoom room and prepare to review the activity.

Share your screen for a walkthrough and discussion of the solution file layouts.

> **Instructor Note:** Most students will have something resembling the solution, with the main hero image, a log-in, and primary navigation. Their mobile and tablet views will also be similar, with fewer cards.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Invite questions from the class or stimulate discussion with your own questions. For example, you might ask:

- What was the goal of your layout? (call on a random student)
- Ask if anyone came up with alternative layouts (e.g., removing the hero image for mobile), and discuss the merits of those layouts.
- Which screen was the hardest to make decisions about?

Now, provide a bit of actionable feedback for the class and address a couple of common misconceptions and FAQs about RWD layout practices:

- Actionable feedback: Point out how working with "real content" in responsive design helps impact layout and composition decisions. A hero space can exist, but what makes it come to life is the content that gets used in that space.

- Actionable feedback: The layout of a responsive page can be reinforced by where your content subject(s) are looking; use the eye gaze to improve layout decisions.

- Misconceptions: "A good web developer will fix any responsive issues in code." *False.* Although the whole team is responsible for making the end user experience look great on all screens, giving developers more detailed views on how a responsive set of elements works will produce a tighter product.

> **Instructor Note:** Let's take a moment to check in with the class and see how comfortable they're feeling with the topic we just covered.
>
> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Consider using Slack, Zoom chat, or a Zoom poll to interact with your class. 
>
> **Fist-to-Five:** Ask your class to rate their level of understanding by raising their hand for a "Fist-to-Five" check. A closed fist (0) means they are lost on the topic and need much more help. An open hand (5) means they completely understand everything that was covered and feel confident and ready to go.

Next, you will support students in going deeper into RWD with a look at navigation patterns—that's your next lecture.

## 7. Instructor Do: Responsive Components and UI Navigation (25 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to help students appreciate navigation as part of usability, which can significantly improve responsive solutions. This lecture supports today's third learning objective, which is for students to execute navigation solutions for mobile.

Now that students are familiar with creating responsive layouts, they need to learn how navigation design relates to RWD. Understanding navigation design will prepare them for adding navigation elements to their RWD layouts.

> **Instructor Note:** This is a long section. Be sure to inject anecdotes along the way to bring learning to life for students. Anecdotes connect what students are learning in the classroom to your real-world experiences.
>
> - Be sure to ask TAs to share their own professional examples, too.
> - Look for the :gem: for opportunities to share anecdotes.

### Responsive Components

In modern web projects, responsive design and flexible layouts are common practice. It is very hard to create content that works on every screen and be aware that *not every element* of a website looks great big as well as small.

- Fluid grids use columns that scale and resize content.

- When an element has a fluid width, its width expands and contracts as the screen size changes. This button fluidly scales within the right two columns.

- Don’t use a container on fluid components if it’s too narrow to display elements and padding at smaller widths.

- Use caution when spanning a fluid component across several columns in a widescreen. Specific components, like buttons, might be overly emphasized on larger screen widths.

> :gem: **Designer Insight**: Say something about responsive components, such as how tricky it can be to design a flexible layout—"not every element of a site looks great both big as well as small."

### Responsive UI Navigation

Any good global navigation scheme should answer the top three questions every user has when on a page:

1. Where have I been? Past.
2. Where am I? Present.
3. Where can I go? Future.

UI navigation is essential to product usability and can help make a webpage more of a utility for the user.

- On a website, “navigation” doesn’t just mean links. UI navigation is, like most elements of a website, about communicating with the user. Good UI navigation tells a story, and good stories have a beginning, middle, and end. UI navigation also has three parts, which communicate to users about their past, present, and future.

Remember:

1. Never, ever link to the page you're on.
2. Show where you are.
3. Think before you link.

> :gem: **Designer Insight**: Say something about navigation and how you approach it as an essential element in your work.
>
> - Feel free to let a TA field this anecdote.

### Responsive UI navigation breadcrumb example

- We see a typical breadcrumb UI pattern on a checkout page of an e-commerce website. Breadcrumbs are a great tool to communicate past, present, and future states for a user. In this case, the user's past was browsing from the homepage, the shop page, and then the cart page. Presently, the user is on the checkout page. The future requires the user to fill out the information, submit payment, and probably receive a success message after the payment is processed.

- Studies show that navigation is crucial if your website sells things or tries to convince a user to come back. The navigation of a site informs whether visitors deem the site trustworthy or not.

### Responsive Desktop UI Navigation Patterns

1. **A vertical navigation** menu is just as effective as its horizontal counterpart, with clear distinctions between pages and easily recognizable functionality.

2. **Full-screen navigation** fills the entire screen.

3. **Fixed/sticky navigation** requires seeing the entire screen header and is usually accompanied by standard drop-down menus. It should indicate where a user is located.

4. **Parallax scrolling navigation** allows content to scroll at different speeds, allowing interacting with a scrolling experience.

### Responsive UI Navigation and the Mobile First Approach

The first things that are affected in a mobile first world, or at least should be, are content and information architecture strategies. The small screen cannot allow for the navigation to be part of the layout due to size.

- Intel’s navigation is complex, and small viewports exacerbate that complexity. Notice that the navigation has tabs, a list of links, and subcategories in a small space.

### Responsive Mobile UI Navigation Patterns

We have many options today for responsive navigation. Web designer and author Brad Frost has cataloged most, if not all, of these patterns on his website, This Is Responsive.

1. **Hamburger navigation:** The hamburger menu allows the designer to free up screen real estate by shifting options off-screen into a side menu. This pattern can be particularly useful if you want the user to focus on the main content.

   - Screen space is a precious commodity on mobile, and the hamburger menu (or side drawer) is one of the most popular mobile navigation patterns for saving screen space. The drawer panel lets you hide the navigation beyond the left edge of the screen and reveal it only upon a user’s action.

   - Pros: The main advantage of the hamburger navigation menu is that it can accommodate a reasonably large number of navigation options in a tiny space.
   - Cons: It is less discoverable.

   - What’s out of sight is out of mind. When navigation is hidden, users are less likely to use it. While this type of navigation is becoming standard, and many mobile users are familiar with it, many people still don’t think to open it.

2. **Tab bar navigation:** Tab bars are conventional on Android and iOS devices. They are becoming a trend in mobile-first web design as well. Tab bars outperform hamburger menus for discoverability while user testing.

   - The tab bar pattern is inherited from desktop design. It usually contains relatively few destinations of similar importance that require direct access from anywhere in the app.

   - For example, YouTube tested a tab bar design and replaced the hamburger menu due to the results.

   - **TAs:** Slack out into the #resources channel for students to review at home:
     - [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/)

3. **Do very little navigation:** This pattern makes navigation a priority and does not hide the navigation behind any progressive disclosure. Most responsive navigation patterns involve progressive disclosure. While the disclosure is a good option, we should only pursue it when a better option does not exist.

4. **Multilevel toggle navigation:** Most applications can get away with two navigation levels—the sweet spot for most implementations. In small view ports, this pattern enables users to toggle the subsections easily and see the contents within.

5. **Simple toggle navigation:** This is another good option and is a variant of the previous pattern. In this case, we do not need multiple levels. However, navigation items are still too numerous to allow for the “do very little” pattern.

6. **Full-screen navigation:** This navigation is adapted from mobile where the desktop fills the whole screen.

7. **Shelf navigation:** Shelf navigation can be on either the left or right rail of the screen, and they typically mirror the mobile navigation structure. Shelf navigation is best when it has an affordance to see the shelf and it animates in and out.

8. **Overlay navigation:** Overlay navigation typically drops down from the header navigation and uses rich media to display content sections' navigation items. Large overlay navigation are used by media companies and car websites as they are prone to sharing large images and video content that operates as an advertisement in their navigation. An overlay navigation should be animated and needs to be optimized for speed, as waiting for a navigation to load is very bad UX.

9. **Pull-down menu navigation:** The pull-down menu relies on the mobile gesture of swiping down. This can improve interaction design through animation.

10. **Drop-down menu navigation:** The drop-down menu is a very standard menu pattern. Drop-down options should not be too many, and drop-downs must have clear affordance.

> :gem: **Designer Insight**: Take a moment to share your own way of incorporating these 10 mobile design patterns into your own work.

### Responsive UI Navigation Tips

1. Make it visible
2. Show the task in the menu
3. Communicate location
4. Pin the menu during scroll

### Discuss additional tips

- Try not to hide navigation items inside menus when there is space to include them.
- Use a good menu, visual weight, and color contrast.
- Avoid long lists in menus. Use zebra lists to assist legibility.
- Be clear with your user tasks, labels, and graphics.
- Make menu labels easy to scan with clear spacing, logical titles, and legible typography.
- “Where am I?” is a fundamental question a user needs to answer to navigate a webpage successfully. Users rely on visual cues from menus to answer this critical question.
- Utilize breadcrumbs.
- Adjust for the “fat thumb.”

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note**: As UX/UI designers, your role will be to make usable, useful, and hopefully delightful UI navigation solutions. Your professional colleagues will recognize your ability to execute a variety of navigation schemes and deploy responsive best practices in your portfolios. Apply these skills effectively and add them to your resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

Doing is believing. Now that students have a sense of how navigation elements work in RWD's context, it is time for them to try it themselves.

## 8. Student Do: Part 1: RWD Navigation Figma/Adobe XD Challenge Activity (25 min)

> :pushpin: **Instructor Note:** This is the first of a three-part activity that will span most of the class's remainder.
>
> Introduce the activity by connecting its importance to the real world of design. Say why it's important to know how to be able to redesign and perform a usability test for a responsive homepage using an Adobe XD UI library or Figma UI kit.

> - This satisfies today's fourth, and final, learning objective.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note**: As UX/UI designers, you will be expected to be able to execute solutions *in the moment* with your teams on the job. Being able to execute quickly will improve your skills for the long term and prepare you for the fast-paced world of web design.

We will be using class time as a safe place to practice our RWD UI skills.

- **TAs:** Slack out the following Google Doc activity and template for students:

  - [11-Week/02-Activities/11.1/11.1-02-RWD-Navigation-Challenge-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wDk8UAMpVnbvHmH-94ZJjzIb-LPLOuCs6FEhuWaJCkQ)
  - [11-Week/02-Activities/11.1/11.1-02.1-Navigation Start Wireframe.png file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13PT-fZlXYAU4SpWO21Xo68aNObtf3AAJ/view)

**Summary**

Students are practicing reordering content and making three different types of layouts work responsively. While the skill is the same, each of the three layouts' context and content are different.

**Instructions**

Working independently, students experiment and design RWD layouts.

> ***Student Note:*** Make sure to take screengrabs, as capturing the process is essential and relevant to portfolios. The process matters, as your first idea or layout sketch is rarely the final product. Capturing images of your design process will be useful later, and you will be thankful you have them when putting together your portfolios.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Encourage students to use Figma to rebuild their screen sizes and grids. Students will work on this independently; have everyone share their screens in Zoom so that you and the TAs can move from student to student and spotlight individual students.

**Instructor and TAs**

Use this time to navigate among the students' screens and check on various students as they work. Some may need help reordering their responsive content from desktop to mobile and back again.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Using Figma, utilize the comment feature, and leave comments on students' executions as they work.

**Deliverable**

Students will post RWD challenge solutions to Slack that show their ability to scale between screens.

## 9. Instructor Do: RWD Navigation Figma/Adobe XD Challenge Activity Review (10 min)

**Launch the Adobe XD solution file:** [11-week/05-Instructor Resources/11.1-solution-files/11.2-Activity-02-Solution-Navigation/XD file](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gk51oJX2suMYV1wPuUllncnEtsrEjUgD)

Call everyone back into the common Zoom room, share your screen, and walk through the solution.

What to show:

1. The landing page solution contains a responsive header and footer navigation.

2. The landing page solution shows a state change with a drop-down menu to expand the categories.

3. The mobile menu shows a full-screen menu when you click on the hamburger button.

4. Bonus: The mobile menu shows a state change for what a user would see when logged into the app.

Now, provide a bit of actionable feedback for the class as well as address a couple of common misconceptions about RWD navigation considerations:

- Actionable feedback: Look for spacing issues or consistency in navigation layouts between screens and reinforce the importance of consistency in UI spacing.
- Actionable feedback: Look for consistency in the use of menu iconography between mobile and desktop.
- Misconceptions: "Responsive menus are always in the upper right of a webpage or app." *False.* The affordance of your responsive navigation is up to you as a designer, but it requires user testing and being consistent over time.

Take questions to ensure that everyone understands the concepts. For anyone who needs additional explanation, remind them to stay after class for office hours.

## 10. Break (15 min)

Time for a break!

Let students know that when they return, they'll take the next step in the RWD process by testing their layouts.

> :globe_with_meridians: Don't stop sharing your screen: Put up a Google timer or a YouTube timer video to help get students back into the Zoom room on time.

-  [YouTube 15 min Timer videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=15+min+timer)

## 11. Student Do: Part 2: RWD Navigation Testing Activity (15 min)

**TAs,** Slack students the following file: [11-Week/02-Activities/11.1/11.1-03-RWD-Test-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11Rs18KxAmIwopT4Z7PJmM_2eBtUMmrnEnobMBcf8law).

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Use Zoom breakout rooms. Prepare to group students into small Zoom breakout groups, and assign TAs to specific rooms to offer support during this activity. Students will conduct user testing, so have them use the "remote access" feature in Zoom to take over each other's screens and click through the navigation during a test.

- Zoom Remote Access Feature: [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control)
- > **Instructor Note:** Quickly demo the "remote access" feature in Zoom if you feel students will fumble with that feature in their individual breakout rooms.

**Summary**

Students will practice testing RWD layouts that challenge their ability to gain feedback and make iterations. If students finish early, encourage them to continue testing.

**Instructions**

Assign students to small breakout rooms—grouping them according to who is working on the same responsive solutions. In their breakout rooms, students will discuss their findings and give feedback.

**Instructor**

Moving from group to group, use this time to check in with students in their breakout rooms as they test their solutions. They may need help gathering feedback on their responsive solutions.

- > globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: TAs can be assigned to particular breakout rooms or they can move among the breakout room groups. Use Slack to answer questions.

**Deliverable**

Students will post RWD challenge iterations to Slack that show their ability to apply feedback.

## 12. Instructor Do: RWD Navigation Testing Activity Review (5 min)

Bring students back to the main Zoom room, share your screen, and lead a review of the testing activity.

- Start by scrolling through the deliverables that students posted in Slack.

- Choose two to four pieces of student work that look interesting, and invite the students to share their testing experiences and outcomes.

- > globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Either spotlight the students' screen or ask them to share their screen while they share their work.

### Possible Discussion Questions

Ask the following questions, or stimulate discussion by creating a Zoom poll with these questions.

- What surprised you about the feedback you received?
- Were there any errors that everyone who tested experienced?
- If you were to rerun the test, what would you do differently?
- How often do you think a responsive usability test should run?

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share an anecdote about your own experience with testing or about designing RWD navigation.

Now, provide students with some actionable feedback and address a couple of common misconceptions related to testing:

- Actionable feedback: Look for usability testing issues where your user was confused or had to squint, or went back and forth in your navigation. These are telltale signs of usability issues.
- Actionable feedback: **ABTI: always be testing and iterating!** Add nuance to the navigation interaction states by improving color usage, including drop-shadows, or by applying gradients.
- Misconceptions: "Testing your navigation once will help you catch all your navigation usability issues." *False.* UI navigation, especially in RWD will require a lot of attention and iteration.

Take questions to ensure that all students are grasping these concepts.

Now students are ready to move on to the third and final part of the three-part RWD design challenge: designing a responsive landing page layout.

## 13. Student Do: Part 3: RWD Landing Page Challenge Activity (20 min)

**TAs:** Slack out to students the following two files:

- [11-Week/02-Activities/11.1/11.1-04-RWD-Landing-Page-Challenge-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PlCbtkySN4yJedtb1-5Y2R8bfNTEPKXr1mXGLagPxyU)
- [11-Week/02-Activities/11.1/11.1-04.1-Desktop Start Wireframe Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ivPgRYJLOBBohvDtVdpOiFbc4oTclgUV/view)

**Summary**

Students will practice creating RWD layouts that challenge their ability to iterate a system of screens quickly.

**Instructions**

Working alone, students will iterate their RWD layouts based on the user tests they conducted in the previous activity.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students can use either Figma (recommended for online) or Adobe XD to iterate their RWD screens. Students will work on this independently; have everyone share their screens in Zoom so that you and the TAs can move from student to student and spotlight individual work. If students need more time in the activity, feel free to shorten the review time.

**Instructor and TAs**

Keep everyone motivated by moving among the students' screens, noticing where students are stuck, and offering guidance on how they can approach iterating their solutions.

**Deliverable**

Students will post RWD challenge solutions to Slack that show their ability to incorporate feedback from user testing into their designs.

## 14. Instructor Do: RWD Landing Page Challenge Activity Review (10 min)

**Review two solution files for your demo:**

1. Landing Page Mobile Categories: [11-week/05-Instructor Resources/11.1-solution-files/11.2-Activity-04-Solution-Navigation/XD file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m2jvz9WGb3i6KqdbplQChXSxg9-PuOOE).

2. Landing Page Mobile Categories Expanded: [11-week/05-Instructor Resources/11.1-solution-files/11.2-Activity-04-Solution-Navigation/XD file](https://drive.google.com/a/2tor.com/file/d/1EKD-LySilqQ3j2fbjSH-58swHEnyC5T_/view?usp=sharing).

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Now, bring everyone back to the main Zoom room, share your screen, and walk through the solution.

Next, invite two to three students to share their solution.

- Invite students who share their work to talk about their process.
- Spotlight each student as they share their work.
- > **Ask:**
  - *What did you learn?*
  - *What would you do differently?*

> **Instructor Note:** Invite questions and remind students to take advantage of the office hours if they want more support on these concepts.

Congratulate students on their hard work today!

Students' practice and diligence are paying off, even if they might not realize it yet. Remind students that they relied on a variety of skills learned during the boot camp to work through today's challenges.

## 15. Instructor Do: Recap (2 min)

Great job! You did great today.

As a wrap-up, help students retain what they learned today with a recall exercise.

**Review concepts and reinforce learning.**

Spend a couple of minutes helping students anchor today’s learning by asking them to raise their hands—or post answers in Slack—and offer definitions for the following concepts, all learned today in class:

- Who can share a definition of RWD?
- How are 12-column layouts helpful?
- How do designers make a webpage designed for desktop fit a mobile screen?
- What are some dos and don'ts for RWD?

> **Instructor Note:** Let's take a moment to check in with the class and see how comfortable they're feeling with the topics we just covered.
>
> Stop sharing your screen for a moment and switch to Gallery View in Zoom to see your class on one screen. You can find this option in the top right.
>
> Ask your class to rate their level of understanding by raising their hand for a "Fist-to-Five" check. A closed fist (0) means they are lost on the topic and need much more help. An open hand (5) means they completely understand everything that was covered and feel confident and ready to go.

Tell students they'll use the skills that they just practiced for their weekly challenge, so they should work on the challenge while the lessons are still fresh (i.e., don't procrastinate!).

## 16. Instructor Do: Units 11 and 12 Challenge Assignment and End Class (8 min)

- Introduce and review the Units 11 and 12 Challenge Assignment.

- **TAs,** slack out the following Challenge link to the class:
  - [11-Week/04-Homework/01-Instructions/Homework 11 Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PwnAhmtiWhhPs6JfDSVH_qMfzYxPP5AN9-TuDIpL2To)

- Walk through the Challenge deliverables and remind students that we will be learning some of these skills throughout the week.

- We're getting to where the rubber hits the road. In the challenge assignment, students will apply all their UI skills to produce their government agency webpages this week.

  - Recommend that students make progress, bring their work into office hours for feedback, and share their clickable prototypes via Slack as well.

- Say emphatically: "Do not wait until the last minute to complete your challenge assignments! Design is iterative, and if you attempt to complete it all at once, you'll be unhappy with your results. Trust us!"

  - Everyone should be adding to their RWD prototypes and making progress on their challenge.

- Office hours are after class.

Take questions and wish everyone a good night.
