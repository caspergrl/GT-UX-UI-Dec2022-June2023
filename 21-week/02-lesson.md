# 21.2: Measuring Success with Analytics


## Overview

In today's virtual class, you will help students understand the basics of what makes websites successful and the metrics companies use to determine success. You’ll work together to create a proto-persona for the primary user of their design portfolios. Students will then determine the KPIs that work best for their design portfolio, establishing how they will measure success. You’ll demonstrate creating a Google Analytics account - students will be responsible for adding the tag to their portfolio websites as part of this week’s challenge deliverables. Finally, you’ll give a brief overview of what to expect in the next class - pitching final projects! 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand website analytics and measuring success.
* Define KPIs for individual portfolio websites.
* Install Google Analytics on their portfolio website.
* Create a proto-persona for the primary visitor to portfolio websites.

## Instructor Notes

* Make a copy of today’s slide deck: [21.2-Measuring Success with Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15l48bqF_6nTt4KoVrT9pMOle029gwEIzElGjrr9z6e4).
* Read through this entire lesson plan, slides, and student activity files to prepare.
* You will **DEMO** how to [create a Google Analytics account](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GmkYPEMbXzYGpehqdp5oJaRB0T5eHRCGdtAn9FD-Cjs/edit?usp=sharing).
* Encourage your students to make the most out of class and not to be afraid to ask questions. Remind students to utilize office hours for questions at key points during class, like after you've taken questions at the end of a lecture or activity reviews.

## Office Hours


Encourage students to work on their portfolio during Office Hours. Be willing to try to debug something you haven’t seen before! Usually the problems students run into when building their portfolio on platforms is just not having an awareness of what things are called in the platform vs. what they learned in class. Demonstrating the willingness to jump in and try to understand enough to get them unstuck is such a great example to set for students - they’ll run into lots of issues as a new designer and they need to know that it’s okay to _not know, but_ to be willing to try to find out anyway.

## SLIDE 4
We need to understand how useful and usable our products are which we can do through conducting usability tests, but we can always determine whether or not they're actually successful by setting goals and measuring how our designs perform.

## SLIDE 5
Review

## SLIDE 6
Goals are broad, long-term, achievable outcomes that usually align with the mission and vision of the organization.
    * Describe a few broad goals that a company could set:
        * Sell more products.
        * Reach a wider audience.
        * Improve customer satisfaction.

## SLIDE 7
Objectives are the measurable actions that can be taken to achieve a stated goal.
    * Describe the example objectives and show how they’re related to the long-term, broad goals:
        * Increase the total number of items in customer orders by 10%.
        * Drive product awareness in specific international markets.
        * Engage current customers with an enhanced product experience.

## SLIDE 8
Strategies are the plan of action, steps taken to achieve an objective.
    * Describe the example strategies and explain how they relate to the objectives and goals set:
        * Increase the total number of items in customer orders by 10% _by suggesting related products in context_.
        * Drive product awareness in specific international markets _by creating localized social media posts_.
        * Engage current customers with an enhanced product experience _by creating a post-sale email support sequence_.

Success metrics can be set at different levels of a company and businesses usually call them indicators of success.
    * Indicators are quantifiable evidence that a design solution is or is not working for the business.
    * Typically success metrics are defined two ways:
        * Objectives and key results (OKRs)
        * Key performance indicators (KPIs)

## SLIDE 11
Objectives define what a team is trying to achieve. Key results are the outcomes that will show they have been successful.
    * Example Objective:
        * Increase total number of items in customer orders by 10%.
    * Examples of Key Results:
        * Views of related items increased by 31.7%. 
        * 62% of those views resulted in items being added to cart.
        * 1 in 3 customers purchased related items.
        * Total # of items in order increased by 15%.

## SLIDE 12
KPIs are the individual data points that a team chooses as the most important quantitative measurements for a product’s success.
    * Examples of KPIs:
        * Number of page views of related items.
        * Increase in time spent viewing related items.
        * Related items added to cart + purchase completed.
        * Increase in value of average order amount.
        * Number of items in order increased.

The second category is **ecommerce** sites.

        * **Go to Slide 19:** Share the examples.  

## SLIDE 16
The third category is **lead-generation** websites. 
    * These sites acquire business via name capture. A lead-generation website is similar to a digital brochure; it helps consumers get information about the business with the goal of a sale.
    * **Ask**: How could we define success for lead-generation websites?
        * **Go to Slide 21:** Share the examples. 

## SLIDE 17
The last category is **donation** websites. 
    * A donation website can be considered a one-page sales pitch that gives a user all the information they need to donate to the organization. These sites aim to collect donations. Their goals are similar to lead-generation websites.
    * **Ask**: How could we define success for donation websites?
        * **Go to Slide 23:** Share the examples.
