# 21.3: It’s the Final (Project) Countdown!


## Overview

In today's class, you will lead students through a pitch process where they share the ideas they’ve come up with for final projects. Students will present their ideas with a little context to gain buy-in and build a team. The students will also evaluate each other’s ideas, gauging their own interest levels and the skills they bring to the project. You will walk students through the process of identifying the critical deliverables for their projects, and then they will join their project teams to develop a preliminary project plan. Finally, students will present their project plans to receive feedback and gain approval from the instructional staff.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:


* Convincingly present a project idea to potential teammates.
* Develop questions to assess interest.
* Evaluate project ideas and decide on the top three of interest.
* Determine the best skills, methods, and deliverables for the project.
* Create a preliminary project plan.
* Present their preliminary project plan for approval and feedback.


## Instructor Notes

* Create a copy of today's slides and share them with the class: [21.3 Final Project Pitch Night](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X-lIivqsm68Vyi8ZQCMt_EaRZyekWWBQJmJkq1MpM6s/edit?usp=sharing).
* Before class starts, create a new FigJam or Miro board for tracking project ideas. The TAs should add each project idea on a new sticky note. It doesn’t need to be fancy, just a place to track the ideas where students can then add their dot votes. 


## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on refining their project ideas during Office Hours. Let them know they can use a few slides - no more than 2 or 3 - to support their presentation. Remind them they only have 60 seconds, and to keep them simple!

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Today’s Agenda (5 min)

**Go to Slide 4:** Today’s agenda is exciting and fast-paced! Students will:

* Pitch project ideas to build excitement and get buy-in.
* Vote on projects and build final working groups.
* Determine project requirements and expected deliverables.
* Present final project plans and kick off the final countdown.


## 2. Instructor Do: Pitching Ideas to Get Buy-In (10 min)



* **Go to Slides 5-6:** Review the pitch process:
    * Students should give their project a working name (it doesn’t have to be the final name).
    * Students will get in (virtual) line to pitch. 
        * Have the TAs post a message to the slack channel asking students to **_reply with the name of their project idea._** 
        * Students have already indicated their desire to pitch a project idea, this is for TAs to prepare the FigJam or Miro board for dot voting.
    * Students will get 60 seconds to pitch their ideas.
        * They should focus on the four statements on the right:
            * My name is…
            * The problem I want to solve is…
            * Possible solutions might be…
            * The team skills we will need are…
* **Go to Slide 7:** Review the Frequently Asked Questions:
    * **Can I pitch two ideas?** No, pick your favorite!
    * **What if my idea only has a few votes?** That’s okay, a team can have a minimum of two people and a maximum of five people.
    * **Can I use pitch props, slides, etc. when pitching?** Props and slides are fine, but remember it’s only 60 seconds!

* **Go to Slide 8:** Review what makes a pitch compelling:
    * **Enthusiasm!** Students should show excitement about their project idea because it makes other people get excited and want to join.

* **Go to Slide 9: Potential User Identified:** Students should also have a reasonably good idea of one type of user who has this problem that needs solving.
	* Great example: “Surfers who live close to the ocean are already monitoring the weather, but some surfers want to be notified if they’re in a 30-minute proximity of good waves so they can grab their board and get on the water quickly.”
	* Not great example: “Surfers want to know if there are big waves headed their way.”
    
* **Go to Slide 10: Includes the Problem Identified:** Students should have a reasonable understanding of the problem.  
	* Good example: “Animal shelters often need last-minute foster care for abandoned animals, and their current solution is an old-fashioned phone tree. Improving the technology will make this process faster.”
	* Not great example: “Animal shelters need foster parents for animals that have been abandoned.”
    
* **Go to Slides 11-12: Includes Potential Outcomes or Solutions:** Students should have an idea of the potential outcome, deliverables, or possible solutions.
	* Not great example: “Animal shelters should have an easy way to contact potential foster parents who can take in abandoned animals in a reasonable amount of time.” 
		* This is an _okay_ example because it specifically targets the problem of animal shelters needing to contact potential foster parents. However, it could be improved with a more specific, measurable time goal (what is reasonable?), and a suggestion of the possible deliverables (is it an app? A notification service? A website redesign?).

	* Great example: “I think a possible solution for solving the surfer’s problem could be a combination mobile and smartwatch app that tracks potential weather conditions and sends a notification if peak conditions for big waves are occurring within a 15-mile radius of the user.”
		* This is great because it’s specific about the type of information it requires and the type of notification it will send. It speaks to the modalities that could be used to deliver the notification.


* **Go to Slide 13: Includes Skills Needed:** Students should be able to describe a few of the skills and methods needed to successfully complete the project. 
	* Great example: “I think this project will need people who are interested in conducting user interviews and data synthesis, and people with strong UI and branding skills to create a design system and brand guidelines. We might also need someone who is really good at Bootstrap, or someone who is okay with building a website on Squarespace quickly.”

		* This is great because it identifies specific skills and attributes of potential team members, allowing other students to visualize themselves working in those roles.
	* Not great example: “We need UX and UI designers and someone who wants to do the coding part.”

		* This isn’t a good example because, well, that’s just about everyone in class. It doesn’t feel specific enough!

* **Go to Slide 14:** Answer any questions students have before moving to the pitching activity 


## 3. Class Do: Pitch Projects! (30 min)

* **Go to Slide 15:** Remind students that they only have **_1 minute_** to pitch their ideas. 
	* Share the [21.3-Final Project Pitch Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1shOY5jrKP3xEvMcSH-0TMXovjknYvt_tl3XBCjDc3nw/edit?usp=sharing) document with students. 
	* They will use this to track their excitement level for each project, any questions they have, and what skills they can bring to the team.
	* Let students know that you will control the timer and you’ll start it as soon as they start talking. 
	* Have the TAs add each project idea to the shared FigJam or Miro board you’ve already set up.
	* Make sure each pitch idea has the student name on it!

* Stop sharing your screen.
* Make sure to call time when the minute is up - students will have the opportunity for discussing and asking questions after all pitches are complete.

* **Notes:**
    * Depending on the size of your class, this may take less time, and it’s okay to end early and give students more time to ask questions.
    * If your class is large or many students want to pitch and the time goes over, it’s okay to reduce the amount of time the students have to present their preliminary project plans (or review them in Office Hours after class).


## 4. Instructor Do: Final Project Goals (10 min)

* **Go to Slides 16-17:** Review what is expected of the final project:
    * There should be evidence that all five stages of the Design Thinking process have been applied.
    * The final deliverable should include something that is “live online” such as:
        * A functional, high-fidelity prototype
        * A responsive website
        * A mobile app
    * Two case studies:
        * The brief presentation slide deck (the “highlight reel”).
        * A full case study slide deck (showing end to end deliverables).
* Ask for student questions and ensure everyone is clear on these deliverables before moving on to the next activity.


## 5. Class Do: Project Group Formation (30 min)

* **Go to Slide 18:** Project Group Formation.
* Share the link to the FigJam or Miro board containing the project ideas with the class in Slack.
    * Students should select a sticker, symbol, or a shape (include initials on shapes) to vote on three ideas - only 3 ideas!
    * Students can ask questions of the person who pitched an idea.
        * Note: You and the TAs can also ask questions if students are shy or reluctant to ask. Suggestions include:
            * What format do you think the final deliverable could be?
            * Does something similar exist already?
            * What UX research methods might you use for this project?
            * What tasks or deliverables do you want someone else to do?


## 6. Break (10 min)


## 7. Instructor Do: Identify the Essentials (15 min)


* **Go to Slides 20-21:** Review Final Project Timeline:
    * Students have 9 full class periods to work together, not including outside of class time to work on the projects.
    * Practice Presentations take place on 24.2
    * Final Presentations take place on 24.3

* **Go to Slide 22:** Review the Design Thinking process.

* **Go to Slide 23:** Briefly review the methods that align with each phase of the Design Thinking process.

* **Go to Slide 24:** The Design Process Timeline:
    * This is an example of the design process for creating and deploying a website. It is greatly simplified, but notice that it spans two months!
    * It’s time to acknowledge the 300-lb gorilla in the room: We have three weeks for this final project; there’s not enough time to do everything.
    * This is 100% true of projects in the real world as well. We won’t always be able to apply every method and the whole process to every project. 
    * The design process timeline will be different for each of your group projects, depending on what the goal is.

* **Go to Slide 25:** How can we make the best use of the time we have?
    * One way to determine the design process we will need to follow for our projects is to identify the desired project result.
    * We can then work backwards through the Design Thinking process to identify the most important methods and tasks.
    * Ask students: “What tasks or methods might be most important to complete in the Empathize phase?”
        * Connect the dots with students as they share their ideas - how might that method, task, or skill be helpful in this scenario?
        * Repeat this question and connect-the-dots process for each phase of the Design Thinking process.
    * Tell students “Now let’s look at a couple of projects and see if we can determine what process they followed.”

* **Go to Slide 26:** For this demonstration, you’ll select a pdf from the following options to briefly walk through with students and have them make their best guess as to which methods the students used to complete these projects. 
    * [Karaoke Kingdom](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vrimUgRT_5XqSZioi-fOBTi2Fn-Nq-mn/view?usp=sharing) - a gamified karaoke app
    * [OACT Orthopedic Associates of Central Texas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AqjE26cVUVKrivzL_Ot3e7qpkCscHoO3/view?usp=sharing) - website redesign with language localization and accessibility improvements
    * [Spiffy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oiK_8jaQ_3_IPGjoNAOf6ru_0vxDY1w8/view?usp=sharing) - gamifying cleaning for people who don’t like to clean
    * [ForeverHomes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1letV4gnMKM_uM5YhhKGHdYCRs0PAdSEX/view?usp=sharing) - matching shelter pets with forever homes
    * [Santé](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPAwock7CP4FW0i-7HTV8jn5I5BsRnSS/view?usp=sharing) - a health tracking app for patient self-advocacy
        * You may be able to go through a couple of these projects, but not all five.
        * **Note**: since these are presentation slide decks, not all project methods are identified or called out. 
* **Go to Slide 27:** Answer any questions students may have before moving into the next activity. 


## 8. Student Do: Creating a Preliminary Project Plan (30 min)

In this activity, students will work with their final project groups to review the methods and identify top priority methods and desired information/outcomes.



* **Go to Slide 28:** Tell students: “In this activity, you’ll work with your final project group to build an initial project outline that will guide the work you will do starting next week.” 
    * TAs: slack out this [Final Project Outline Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AYARHeuKElVHSNDtAQZYkMTdfxoMOtNrg6tX2FjyqL4/edit?usp=sharing) for students to make their own copies.
* Remind students:
    * All five phases of the Design Thinking process need to be included.
    * Describe the prioritized methods the team intends to use.
    * Identify some additional methods and activities you’ll complete if the team has time.
* Send students into breakout rooms with their final project groups.
* Visit each group at least once during this activity to answer questions.


## 9. Class Demo: Present Preliminary Project Plans (35 min)

Bring students back to the main room. 

In this activity, groups present an overview of their project plan at a high level. Each group will have about 3-5 minutes, depending on the number of groups.


* **Go to Slide 29:** Remind students that they need to address all five phases of the Design Thinking process.
    * They should describe the methods they will use and what they expect the outcome of those methods to be.
    * They should also describe at least two methods they left out and why.
* Instructional staff: Use this presentation time to consider any suggestions or advice you would give the groups to help them achieve their desired outcomes.


## 10. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* **Go to Slides 30-33:** At the end of the presentations, offer encouragement and excitement about their work. 
* **Questions:** Take a few minutes to answer any questions that students might have about the final project. 
    * Tell students to feel free to post questions on the Slack Channel.
* Reiterate the importance of taking the next few days to get caught up on any design challenges that are outstanding so they can hit the ground running during the next class. It’s the finaaalll countdooooowwwwn.
