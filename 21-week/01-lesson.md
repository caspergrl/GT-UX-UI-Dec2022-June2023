# 21.1: Assessing and Selecting Web Technologies

---

## Overview

In today's virtual class, you will help students as they learn how to assess technologies for how appropriately they are suited to any given project. You’ll briefly explain how a website moves from development to production and introduce where UX fits into the QA process. Students will work together to evaluate hosting technologies for their portfolio and make significant progress on building their employer-ready portfolio. To wrap up the class, you’ll give a sneak preview of the final group project selection process to get them thinking about problems they want to solve for their capstone project.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:


* Describe how a website moves from development to the user.
* Assess hosting technologies for portfolio websites.
* Make an informed decision about portfolio hosting.
* Start building their portfolio website.

## SLIDES 1-3
Review

## SLIDE 4
**Design**: thought and discussion goes into the product before coding.    * **Prototype**: experimentation and usability testing.
**Development**: coding and testing iteratively until the product is done.
**QA (Quality Assurance)**: making sure the product works as intended.
**Launch**: publishing the site for end users.

## SLIDES 5-7

## SLIDE 8
Review

## SLIDE 9
Review the varieties of site hosting options for a design portfolio. Review a few options for hosting a portfolio site and point out the variety of those options, from coding one’s site to using a simple PDF as a way to share a portfolio.
    * Content Management Systems “CMS” (WordPress, Squarespace)
    * Low-Code Solutions (Wix, Webflow) (very similar to CMS, but with access to _some_ code)
    * No-Code Solutions (UXfolio - fully templatized, ‘drag-and-drop’)
    * Code-Your-Own (HTML/CSS/JS)
    * Framework (Bootstrap)
    * Unhosted (PDF)
    * Describe reasons why we would use certain technologies over others: 
        * While some platforms offer low- or no-code options for simple sites, implementing more customization or advanced features will always require code. 
        * In many cases, adding functionality to a CMS or low- or no-code solution can be more difficult than just starting from scratch.
        * It is possible that a certain project would be impossible in one technology, while taking only minutes in another. As with all web technologies, research can save a lot of time.
* Connect the research that students will do into hosting technologies to the need to become familiar with all the options available, so that they can guide future clients who are interested in a first-time site or considering alternatives for site hosting.

## SLIDE 10 
Hosted vs. managed vs. self-hosted - this is primarily associated with Wordpress options, but can also be important to know for potential client work.
    1. A **hosted** WordPress website at Wordpress.com where the blog owner does not have access to the code.
    2. A **managed WordPress** website is when you choose a web hosting provider like porkbun.com or bluehost and that hosting platform provides the framework and back-end management. You usually have access to most code files, but there are generally guardrails around truly destructive behavior.
    3. A **self-hosted WordPress** site is when you find a hosting platform like DigitalOcean that gives you direct access to the root directory where you install a copy of WordPress and have full freedom and control (for better or worse) to every possible line of code.


## SLIDE 11
### 4. Student Do: Evaluating Hosting Technologies (30 min)
Transition to the activity, where students will begin researching hosting options for their portfolio sites, assessing a variety of hosting technologies, while gaining an understanding of the overall site hosting landscape.    

* Ask the TA to Slack out the instructions for the [Hosting Technology Assessment Activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z33OAIpg_ES1u4p7sdqpdnCleqtWCA8-lodIhd_Y8zU/edit?usp=sharing). 
   
	* Put students into eight breakout groups, one for each technology that will be assessed.
    * Assign each group one hosting technology to research. (Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, WordPress, UXfolio, Code-Your-Own, Code with Bootstrap, PDF)
    * Each group will fill out one worksheet for their assigned hosting technology.
    * Set a timer for 30 minutes.
    * You or the TA should visit each breakout room _at least twice_ to check-in and answer any questions.
	* In the next section, Groups will share back their research findings with the class. 


* The ultimate outcome of this activity (and the review) is to provide multiple data points that allow each student to make an informed decision about the hosting technology they will use for their portfolio site. 
* Students will choose what works best for them, which may be different from their group mates.
    * Note: Some students will be comfortable with a paid option, while others will not. Similarly, some students will be comfortable coding their own site, while others won’t want to take the time. Challenge students to review all pros and cons and how they impact this decision before committing to their choice of hosting technology.
* Students may be tempted to just pick an option, so encourage them to take the time to assess each option thoroughly.  
    * The group can elect one person to take notes for each hosting provider they research.  
    * Alternatively, students can add to the hosting technology assessment template together and discuss the pros and cons.  

    * **Note:** If your cohort does not have enough students to assign at least one pair of students to each technology, here are some suggested adjustments:
        * Ask for a show of hands to vote on which technologies students are interested in assessing. Student pairs can choose from those technologies in the class activity. 
        * Students can collaboratively assess the remaining technologies outside of class. Alternatively, consider leading the assessment for any remaining technologies in office hours.
        * Students can choose to assess more than one technology option during the activity in class. 


## SLIDE 12
* Note: This review period should help students decide on their technology choices for their portfolio.
* A volunteer from each group will have 3 minutes to talk through their hosting technology assessment worksheet. 
* Students should have made a copy of the [21.1.2 Hosting Technologies Assessment Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HZuNcnW5z9ioQSZpnXqTrSJdy8h7-8bYrGfB9ZV1vhs/edit?usp=sharing) for themselves and add their own notes for each technology. 
* To help them think further about their work, prompt them with questions like the following: 
    * Was there a deciding factor for the hosting technology that you expect to use for your site?
    * Was there a close second choice and what are its pros and cons? 
    * What, if anything, made you rethink how you want to host your portfolio site?
* Emphasize the following key point: 
    * The content of your portfolio is what matters most.
* **[Optional, if time]** Instructional staff can share what you use for your own portfolios.

### 7. BREAK (10 min)

## SLIDE 17
### 8. Student Do: Start Your Portfolio Website (60 min)

* **Go to Slide 18:** Students work in small groups of people who **chose the same hosting or type of technology.**
	* TAs should create 8 self-managed breakout rooms, each labeled with names for each technology (self-managed, in that students can move themselves in and out of breakout rooms).
	* Getting started will be different for each technology choice, so directions for this activity are not provided. 
	* Students should navigate to the portfolio hosting technology website and follow instructions for getting started together. In their breakout rooms, students can discuss the getting started steps together and troubleshoot any issues they run into. Remind students to request instructional support if needed.

### 9. Instructor Do: Prepare to Pitch Final Project Ideas (10 min)

* **Go to Slide 19:** Give an overview of how the Final Project Idea Pitch Process works:
    * **Go to Slide 20:** Pitches will happen in class 21.3 (not the next class, but the following one) so they have plenty of time to come up with their pitch idea.
        * Get on the list to pitch an idea by messaging instructional staff. 
            * This is only to **create a list of people who want to pitch a project** activity, this is NOT a list of ideas.
            * Instructional staff: please feel free to create a google form for this part if you prefer.
    * Each student will have 60 seconds to describe the problem they want to solve and give a little context.
    * In class 21.3, we will cast dot votes on projects to form teams.
* **Go to Slide 21:** Review the Pitch Format:

        Hi, I’m [name]! 

        The problem I want to solve is [problem].

        The users impacted by this problem are [users]. 

        I think the solution might take the form of [mobile app, website, redesign, smartwatch app, etc.]. 

* **Go to Slide 22:** Review Frequently Asked Questions:
    * **Can I pitch two ideas?**
    	No, pick your favorite.
    * **What if my idea isn’t selected?** 
	Join another team, save your idea for your passion project!
    * **Can I still work on my idea if no one else selects it?**
    	Not unless you can find at least one other person to join your team.
    * **Can I vote on my own idea three times?**
    	No, you have already voted on your idea by presenting it. 
* **Go to Slide 23:** Recommend students start problem-spotting for what they would like to work on.


### 10. Instructor Do: Recap and Introduce Challenge (10 min)

* **Go to Slide 24:** Recap the lesson.
* **Go to Slide 25:** Share the challenge document with students: [Module 21 Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvH2yXy-M40wePu0-BlIx-KkA0H0KR-Iee1FFqKOwOg/edit?usp=sharing). 
    * Open the document and share your screen. 
* **Go to Slide 26:** Walk students through the expectations of the challenge assignment. 
* **Go to Slide 27:** Answer any questions students may have.
