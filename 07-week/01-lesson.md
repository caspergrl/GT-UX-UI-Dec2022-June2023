# 7.1 Lesson Plan: Group Project 1 - Day 06

---

## Overview

Today, students will continue working on Group Project 1. They will be working within the prototyping and testing phase of the design thinking process.   

Students will iterate on their wireframes based on the user testing feedback they gathered, create a new version of a clickable prototype, and conduct usability tests today.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Practice a daily stand up.
2. Make iterations to their prototypes.
3. Create digital wireframes using the iOS or Material design guidelines.
4. Build a clickable prototype in InVision, Adobe XD, or Figma.
5. Conduct more usability testing.

## Class at a Glance

Today has two Work Sessions. Students will start with a standup, then workshop with their groups. When they get stuck, students will turn to instructional staff for help.

Today at-a-glance: 

- Brief Welcome lecture.
- Daily Standup, followed by a review.
- 2 Work Sessions, followed by a review at the end.
- Recap of the day.

**Important:** By the end of the day, students should complete most of the day's objectives.

## Prepare for Class

- **Study your slides:** Here are today's lecture slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/07.1 Group Project 1 - Day 6 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBS78EIjr4vVtinJe4RRD-qizt1BthoTujEtJz51N_U).
- **Plan to stay engaged during class:** Both you and the TAs should be engaging with students throughout the entire day (not "hiding" behind your slide deck or off-screen).
- **Prepare to help students get unstuck:** Review this document in advance so that you can help students during class:  [How to Help Students Get Unstuck guide/document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJKtoLw-7bYNvLxRSyUFso64-y0hStQGCOCXp22drPY/edit?usp=sharing).
  - The guide offers several questions to ask of students during the Working Sessions.
- **Task TAs with helping stuck groups:** If a group is found to be behind schedule, assign a TA to actively workshop with that group to get them back on track. 

- If needed, review [Strategies for Class Online](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/ux-ui-curriculum-version2/tree/master/01-lesson-plans/07-Week#strategies-for-class-online).

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [05-07-Group-Project-1/04-Time Trackers/07.1 Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l-z7daVsBTE-4xozjq9oKn7dPImUS-rMC9tgC_bx9HA/edit?usp=sharing).


Welcome and encourage students to show up early for office hours. It's in their best interest to get the most out of the boot camp.  

> Make office hours valuable. Engage students who show up early to learn. 

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Today's Objectives (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to get students ready for a productive day of workshops.   

### Welcome to class!

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Engage students! Get them into a design mindset. Ask if anyone has come across an interesting design article or any cool industry news. Invite TAs to share what industry news they've heard, too!

Launch your slides:  [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/07.1 Project 1, Day 6 Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBS78EIjr4vVtinJe4RRD-qizt1BthoTujEtJz51N_U).

- First, let students know what today holds. Today they will iterate on wireframes based on the feedback from user testing. Then it's all about creating a new version of a clickable prototype (InVision, Adobe XD, or Figma) and conducting usability tests.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Briefly share a professional anecdote about the prototyping and testing phase of the design thinking process.   

- Next, discuss today's deliverables and requirements for the Work Sessions.
- Finally, review today's objectives.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions. 

Next, it's time for the daily standup!

## 2. Student Do: Daily Standup (10 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Create breakout rooms for student groups. One instructional staff member should observe each group.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Use the same groups as last class.

- Pay attention to students' "today" tasks. Each group should have a full task list.

### Instructions:

2. Each group should answer the following questions:

   - What did I work on yesterday?
   - What am I working on today?
   - What issues are blocking me?
2. Instructional staff should note which groups are behind and assign a TA to work with them.

Next, review how the standups went in a quick review—that's your next two minutes!

## 3. Instructor Do: Review (2 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: TAs can use a breakout room to address blockers. Help groups focus and collaborate on resolving those blockers.

### Blockers:

Encourage groups to work through blockers as a team.
  - When working with teams, the goal is to assist rather than be a taskmaster. What the teams learn today become habits for their design future.
  - There are many UX deliverables team members can be working on. Use your discretion to reorder or reassign deliverables based on individual team dynamics.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask a TA to briefly share about their experience with getting blocked and unblocked.  

Now it's time for students to dig into today's tasks with a Work Session—which runs one hour!

## 4. Student Do: Work Session 1 (60 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to get student groups into working mode and keep the energy high as they make progress.

**Important:** Be sure students can easily refer to the Deliverables and Requirements slide. Either leave that slide up on your screen or cut and paste a snapshot of it into Slack.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Cut and paste a screenshot of the Deliverables slide and share in Slack.

> ::globe_with_meridians: ****Online Recommendation**:** Put student groups into breakout rooms.

- As students work: 
  - Stay engaged! You and the TAs should actively observe and engage with students throughout the entire day—no "hiding" behind your slide deck or off-screen.
    - Similarly, the student teams should not finish early or look idle. If that is the case, jump in and give feedback on deliverables for iteration.
  - Refer to the guide we provided: [How to Help Students Get Unstuck guide/document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJKtoLw-7bYNvLxRSyUFso64-y0hStQGCOCXp22drPY/edit?usp=sharing). The guide offers questions to ask that will benefit students' learning process.
  - Remind students to take photos and screen grabs of their process to document their work and case studies. 

Next, you can take a break.

## 5. Break (15 min-Weekday)

Break time! Take 15 minutes

> **Instructor Note:** During a working session day, the break is for the instructional staff. But if working groups do need a break, they should take one.  

### After break:

students will make further progress on their tasks. Their second Work Session runs one hour and twenty minutes!

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Don't stop sharing your screen! Put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual timer will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

## 6. Student Do: Work Session 2 (80 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to get student groups to complete their tasks for the day. 

**Important:** Be sure students can easily refer to the Deliverables and Requirements slide.  

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Cut and paste a screenshot of the Deliverables slide and share in Slack. Put student groups back into their breakout rooms.

Call the class back to attention.

### Review task lists.

- First, review the deliverables so that students can measure their progress. Those are:
  - Iterate on your user flows (if needed).
  - Iterate on your wireframes based on the feedback from user testing.
  - Create a new version of a clickable prototype (Figma, Adobe XD, or InVision).
  - Conduct usability tests.

> **Instructor Note:** Take time for questions. 

### Work Session 2.

- As students work: 
  - Again, stay engaged! You and the TAs should actively observe and engage with students throughout the day—no "hiding" behind your slide deck or off-screen.
    - Similarly, if a student team finishes early or looks idle, give them feedback on their deliverables for iteration.
  - Continue referring to the guide we provided: [How to Help Students Get Unstuck guide/document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJKtoLw-7bYNvLxRSyUFso64-y0hStQGCOCXp22drPY/edit?usp=sharing), which will help you challenge students to answer their own questions.  

Next, review the two Work Sessions with the class.

## 7. Instructor Do: Review (2 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Close the breakout rooms and call attention back to your screen.

### Lead a review of today's Work Sessions.

- First, have teams report in about task list and deliverables. 
  - Were the sessions productive?
  - Are there still "blockers"? 
  - Other questions to ask: 
    - *Did they finish? What's left to do? Can they get caught up by next class?*
  - If groups are still working on some of the deliverables, that's fine. But the work must be completed before the next class.
- **Tip:** Welcome students who are behind to stay online for Office Hours, where they can get more work done.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how you have adjusted to working in iterations rather than "perfect" or "finished" work in your design career. You can be an inspiration to students who are struggling to make this mental shift.

- Invite a TA to share as well. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.

Next, do a recap of the day, then gear up for Office Hours.

## 8. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)

Congratulate students! They have completed their first day of the 2nd week of Group Project 1.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: "Pat" yourself on the back and encourage students to do the same on their Zoom video screens.
>
> - Alternatively, have everyone join you in a round of applause—:clap: :raised_hands: —celebrate an evening of hard work! 

***Let students know what's due before next class:***

- Before the next class, students need to ensure they've completed all of the Group Project 1 requirements listed in the requirements document: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y/edit#heading=h.6hggydw6dvip](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y/edit#heading=h.6hggydw6dvip).
  - **TAs:** Slack the link out to students. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions.

***Give an Office Hours reminder:*** 

- Remind students that you're staying online as a resource to them. Office hours are after class.
  - **Tip:** If you have a helpful or inspiring anecdote that you didn't have time to share today, entice students to stay after class to hear it!  

- Thank everyone for doing their best work.
- Good night!
