# 7.3 Lesson Plan: Group Project 1, Day 8: UX Prototype Presentations

---

## Overview

Today is an exciting day: student presentations! 

After the presentations and feedback have been given, you will give an overview of the UI section of the boot camp (weeks 8-12). You will also introduce Challenge 7.   

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Present group projects and user experience (UX) prototypes to an audience.
2. Provide constructive feedback to their peers.

## Class at a Glance

Today is student presentations day. It is one of the most rewarding days of class, so enjoy it!

- 95% of today's class consists of presentations. 
  - Presentations will take the full day and time will move very fast! 	
  - Weekday class: be aware that class might run long. Prepare yourself, and students, for that scenario.
  - Have TAs help you keep track of time.

- The remaining 5% of today's class time is reserved for you to introduce the boot camp's UI section, weeks 8-12, and introduce Challenge 7. 


## Preparing for Class

- ***Make sure everyone has uploaded their presentations to the Presentations folder on the Google Drive.***
    - Last class you created a folder labeled "Presentations" inside the 05-07-Week-Project-01 folder.
- **Review the lecture slides:** [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/07.3-Group Project 1 Presentations Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y1uaNsKSVPGlwPWLs3EAr4nm2RkByBSx9hBlACfLZO4/edit#slide=id.g480f0dd0a7_0_1809).

### Prepare for smooth presentations:
  - Each presentation will run 15 minutes:
    - The presentation itself: 10 minutes.  
    - Feedback and critique: 5 minutes. 
  - Be sure to set a timer for each presentation to keep everyone on track.

> **Instructor Note:**
>
> - Load the presentations on your computer as tabs in your browser! That way groups can quickly transition into presenting.
>
> - Some instructors allow students 15 minutes for presentations and create an asynchronous feedback cycle where the instructor and teaching assistants (TAs) write down their feedback and provide it to the student groups after class.  

- **Review more tips in the 'Strategies for Presentations Online,' below.** 
- **Using Zoom:** It takes time to become proficient using Zoom, the primary online instructional tool. Please refer to the following guide for help performing essential online presentation tasks (sharing screens, managing group feedback, etc.):

- If needed, review [Strategies for Class Online](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/ux-ui-curriculum-version2/tree/master/01-lesson-plans/07-Week#strategies-for-class-online).  


## Class Video

Once the student presentations are complete, take time to share their work. Submit student presentations to the form below. *This will assist future instructional staff!*

- Share student work at: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6_0EfS7ANuOvPwUA2w1PQ6uvL9eLl1MXjDHsfI30kdVlTkw/viewform?c=0&w=1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6_0EfS7ANuOvPwUA2w1PQ6uvL9eLl1MXjDHsfI30kdVlTkw/viewform?c=0&w=1)

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [05-07-Group-Project-1/04-Time Trackers/07.3 Timetraker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RKuodu4sANAiQDySS0zseGNSfQPappJBAwP254pZzsc/edit?usp=sharing).


Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).


## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Welcome and encourage students to show up early for office hours. It's in their best interest to get the most out of the boot camp.

> **Instructor Note:** Do your part. Make office hours valuable and engage students who show up early to learn. 

---
## NEW: Online presentation strategies:

1. Have everyone—except the presenting team—mute their audio.
2. Have everyone quit Slack.
3. Disable the Zoom chat.
   - [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207442843-Disable-Notifications-From-Group-Chat-Mobile-](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207442843-Disable-Notifications-From-Group-Chat-Mobile-).
4. Encourage students to take notes while watching the presentations. Their notes will be helpful in providing feedback later. 

> **Instructor Note:** Remember to record the presentations in Zoom so that they can later be shared.

- Online presentations have their challenges. Know that we appreciate your hard work. The curriculum team is very interested in how things go in your classrooms, both wins and failures. Please post your feedback in the "05-UX-UI-Course channel" or direct message (DM) @jmesias or @mfoley with anything you want to share.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Group Project 1 Presentation Setup (1 min)

### Welcome to class!  

Launch your slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/07.3-Group Project One Presentations Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y1uaNsKSVPGlwPWLs3EAr4nm2RkByBSx9hBlACfLZO4/edit#slide=id.g480f0dd0a7_0_1809).

- First, let students know what today holds: 
  - Today is presentation day. Everyone has worked very hard toward this day! 
  - There will be two presentation periods with a break in-between. During their presentation, each group will be given a 10-minute presentation as a group. Following each presentation, there will be five minutes for feedback from classmates and the instructional staff.
  - We'll take a look forward at weeks 8-12, which are the boot camp's UI section.
  - You will also introduce the Weekly Challenge.   

- Next, walk through today's learning objectives. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions quickly and get right into presentations. 

- Before moving on, praise the class for how hard they have worked on their group projects! Advise them to give each group their full attention.  

Finally, begin the presentations! 

## 2. Student Do: Student Presentations 1 (90 min)

Again, congratulate students on getting to this point! 

Here's why: Students have been pushing hard for seven weeks. They have accomplished more than they can possibly realize. You can help students take pride this accomplishment. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Set the mood! Get creative! Play energizing (appropriate) music before the presentations begin.

### Set a relaxed tone.

Students will be nervous. Let them know that you get nervous before a presentation, too. It comes with the territory.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Lead the whole class in a quick breathing exercise before the first group begins. Have everyone turn off their cameras to preserve privacy, if desired. 

> **Say:** "Everyone. Let's de-stress. Join me in a two-step breathing exercise. Take a deep breath and hold it for four seconds:  *one-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand, four-one thousand*. Now, exhale to the count of four seconds: *one-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand, four-one thousand*." Repeat for one more breath, then move on. 

### Foster a supportive environment.

Clapping will generate a supportive vibe for all teams. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Take everyone off mute so that the whole class can join you and the TAs and ***clap—before each group starts and after each group's presentation ends***.

### Presentation Set Up:

- Begin by announcing the names of the first group of students. 
- Give the group a couple of minutes to set up. 
- > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**—Use the following Zoom settings: 
  - Have the presenter launch their presentation slides and share their screen. 
  - Then, they should select "Speaker View" in their Zoom display settings. 
  - The rest of the class must be muted. 
  - When the first presenter speaks, their voice will trigger their video to display. The class will be able to view their face in a small display in the upper corner.  
  - When it's time for the next group member to present their section, they should come off mute and begin speaking. 

### During Presentations:

- Don't speak! Do not say anything during the presentation. Do not interrupt.
  - Remember, you are recording the presentations. 

### After Presentations:

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: The presenter should stop sharing their screen. Bring the class's attention to your screen to lead a feedback session. Check for raised hands in Zoom.

- Follow each of the presentations with a 5-minute feedback/Q&A session.  
- Invite feedback—> **Say:** "Does anyone have a thought or two to share about what you just saw?"
  - A TA can jump in and start if no one else begins.    
- When the Q&A session concludes, point out what you found impressive and what the group can improve on for future demonstrations.

Next, give everyone a break. 

## 3. Break (15 min)

If class presentations are running long, shorten the break to just 5 minutes.

> **Say:** "After the break, the second set of presentations will begin. If you're the first group to present, please get your content ready."

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Don't stop sharing your screen! Put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual timer will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

## 4. Student Do: Student Presentations 2 (75 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Set an enthusiastic tone by playing energizing (appropriate) music before the second half of the presentations begin. 

### Foster a supportive environment.

Clapping will generate a supportive vibe for all teams. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Take everyone off mute so that the whole class can join you and the TAs and ***clap—before each group starts and after each group's presentation ends***.

### Presentation Set Up:

- Begin by announcing the names of the first group of students to present in the second half. 
- Give the group a couple of minutes to set up.

- When the Q&A session concludes, point out what you found impressive and what the group can improve on for future demonstrations.

### It's a wrap—congratulate students on their hard work!*

Take a moment to communicate to students that they should be proud of their hard work. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take any final thoughts, feedback, and questions.  

> **Say:** "Everyone, let's give ourselves a giant round of applause."

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Encourage everyone to clap for their classmates over their laptop cameras.

Next, you are going to switch gears and give students a preview of Challenge 7! 

## 5. Instructor Do: Assign Challenge 7 (3 min)

**TAs,** Share the Unit 7 Challenge instructions on Slack: [05-07-Group-Project-1/04-Homework/01-Instructions/07-Unit-Homework-Instructions Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SGvtXNQHHRncup644mf4zjcAsMn4L7LyDE2TKwS9pL8/edit?usp=sharing).

### Review the deliverable for the weekly challenge.

- Share your screen, open the Challenge document, and review it with students. 
- Challenge 7 high points:
  - Due to course grading requirements, ***each group member must submit a link to the group's project*** case study, individually, to receive a grade.
    - Students must post a link in Bootcamp Spot.  
  - If students want to take their challenge a step further, they can create a case study. 
    
> Take questions about the weekly challenge. 

Next, move on to recap the day. 

## 6. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)

Not only have students completed their presentations and first group project, but they have also completed the UX portion of the boot camp! 

### Prepare students for the next section: UI - User Interface Design.

- Next class, we'll kick off the UI units (units 8-15). 
- Walk through the highlights of the coming weeks:
  - During the next five weeks of homework, the design challenge will entail redesigning a government agency RWD website.
- Encourage students to start practicing with the UI software tools:
  - Adobe XD and Adobe XD prototype 
  - Figma
  - Sketch, Craft, and InVision

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Invite a TA to briefly share the key characteristics of UI—user interaction—to help imagine what's to come.

- Remind students that they should use office hours if they have further questions about any past week’s topics or upcoming deliverables.

- Thank everyone for doing their best work. 

- Good night!

> **Instructor Note:** Please share strong Group 1 projects in the 05-UX-UI-course channel in the Trilogy Slack.
