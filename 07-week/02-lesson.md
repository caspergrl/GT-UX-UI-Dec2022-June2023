# 7.2 Lesson Plan: Group Project 1, Day 7: How to Design a Case Study

---

## Overview

Last class, students finalized their prototypes. In today's lesson, students move out of the prototyping and testing phase and into presentation preparation of their proven concepts.  

Students will also learn how to design a case study for their design portfolios today.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Write a case study outline for their Group Project 1 presentation. 

2. Build a UX Group Project 1 case study in Google Slides.

3. Prepare oral presentations.

## Class at a Glance

We have divided today into two parts:

Part One: Completing a UX case study outline. 

Part Two: Building out their case study in Google Slides as preparation for their presentations.

***Before the next class:*** Students must upload their presentations to the class Google Drive folder.

## Preparing for Presentations

- **Important:** Next class, students will present their work, so be sure to review the presentation preparation section.

- Presentation days move very quickly. It is important to prepare for the next class by making sure all student groups have a presentation slot assigned or chosen.

- **Important:** Create a class Google Drive for students to upload their presentations. This is to speed up the transition between groups presenting.

  - Create a folder in the 05-07-Week-Project-01 Folder.

  - Label the folder "Presentations."

- ![Template](Images/gDrive.png)

- **Important:** Make a copy of the presentation itinerary Google Sheet, upload it to the Presentation folder, and instruct students to sign up for a presentation time.

## Prepare for Class

- **Using Zoom:** It takes time to become proficient using Zoom, the primary online instructional tool. Please refer to the following guide for help performing essential online presentation tasks (sharing screens, managing group feedback, etc.):
    - [Zoom Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MtogY4tO4aMPgQ0mlHpdtvi8rmkt9efN__mBngs9tg/edit)
    
- **Review lecture slides:** [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/07.2-Group Project 1 Presentation Prep Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_m7u7gHkfVHMHUowHw9nyCgdKYbkknT5KGMcp3Q_4wM/edit?usp=sharing).

- **Remember:** It is OK if students are still working on their projects. Encourage them to keep going, but also let them know that now is the time to prepare for their presentations. Communicate to students that, as designers, our work is never finished. It is very common to present "unfinished" work.

- If needed, review [Strategies for Class Online](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/ux-ui-curriculum-version2/tree/master/01-lesson-plans/07-Week#strategies-for-class-online).

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have the teaching assistants (TAs) consult the [05-07-Group-Project-1/04-Time Trackers/07.2-Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R39_1vUOUcX6x1GlK4W7dYiLd02lFOcU8wsfldYpjqw/edit#gid=746489284).


Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

---


## Office Hours: Each class, before class (45 min)

Welcome and encourage students to show up early for office hours. It's in their best interest to get the most out of the boot camp.

> Make office hours valuable. Engage students who show up early to learn.


---

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Week Overview (3 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to get students excited about preparing to present their first group project.  

### Welcome to class! 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Engage students! Get them into a design mindset. Ask if anyone has come across an interesting design article or any cool industry news. Invite TAs to share what industry news they've heard, too!

Launch your slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/07.2-Group Project 1 Presentation Prep Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_m7u7gHkfVHMHUowHw9nyCgdKYbkknT5KGMcp3Q_4wM/edit?usp=sharing).

- First, let students know what today holds: Today, students will focus on building their case studies and preparing their presentations. Next class, they will spend the day presenting their work.  

- Next, share an anecdote about presenting your work: 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how it was for you the first couple of times you presented your work—mention whether it was with a group or solo.

- Finally, review today's learning objectives.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions.

Next, walk through tips for presenting and the requirements for the group project.

## 2. Instructor Do: Group Project 1 Presentation Requirements and Tips (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to help students get ready to start preparing their presentations. 

Today's focus is on preparing for case study presentations. Students will need to complete their online case study and prep and practice their presentations. 

### Review the deliverables and requirements.

Group Project 1 presentations will be presented during your next class.

*Presentation guidelines:* 

- Presentations: must run 10 minutes.

- Feedback: each group will receive five to 10 minutes of constructive feedback.

*Presentation requirements:*

- Presentations should be in Google Slides. 
- Prototypes should be completed, clickable, and part of the presentation.
- Submissions must contain 10 to 15 slides with no font smaller than 12 points.

*Tips —*

Students must be sure to do the following in their presentations:

- Set up the problem.
- State the value proposition or problem statement.
- Define the user persona (including goals, needs, potential gains/opportunities).
- Cite user research.
- Illustrate the user journey/storyboards.
- Outline user testing.
- Describe iterations based on problems encountered.
- Present final prototype (mobile).

***Each team member should present an equal share of the work.***

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Invite a TA to share a funny and encouraging anecdote about presenting their early design work. 

### Presenting design work:

> **Say:** "Did you know that 70% of employed Americans say that presentation skills are critical for career success?"

- **TAs,** Slack out the following Forbes article for students to read at home:

  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/09/25/new-survey-70-percent-say-presentation-skills-critical-for-career-success/#4af2bbef8890](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/09/25/new-survey-70-percent-say-presentation-skills-critical-for-career-success/#4af2bbef8890).

### Why UX design presentations are essential:

We have to sell our ideas if we want to get a 'green light' from clients. For designers, this means we need to get used to public speaking and presenting. Behind every presentation is a story. Once you know the story you want to tell, the presentation's design should support the message.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a story about realizing how important presentation skills were to your effectiveness as a designer.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Engage the class when you talk about presentation tips. Have students engage by raising their hands to speak or addressing the question via Slack as you ask questions that tap into students' prior knowledge.

> **Ask:** What makes someone an effective presenter?  

First, discuss the positive effect of learning to present your work.  

### The benefits of presentation skills:

- Increase your self-confidence.
- Learn an effective way to communicate your ideas through semi-public sharing.
- Demonstrate your knowledge to teams, stakeholders, and fellow designers.
- Refine your presentation skills through practice, as they'll be expected of you throughout your career.

Next, discuss where presentations can go wrong.

### Why UX design presentations go wrong:

- It can be hard to figure out the 'story' you're trying to tell with your presentations.
  - You want to put your designs in the right light.
- The challenges of presenting a UX design vary from project to project.
  - One size does not fit all when it comes to presenting UX work.
- Trying to do too much in a limited amount of time results in a rushed, scattered effort.

  - It's best to limit your slides to 10 to 15 and spend just 45 to 60 seconds on each.
- Not 'reading' your audience or ignoring the physical space can make a presentation awkward or even worse, frustrating for others.

  - Don't use typography under 12 points.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause briefly for questions.

Next, cover the top "gotchas" that come up during design presentations.

### Common issues include:

- Talking UX jargon to laypeople.
- Relying on wireframes to get your point across.
- Not validating ideas before presenting them.
- Making presentations too short or too long.
- Succumbing to performance anxiety.

Now talk about the value of practicing your presentation.

### How to improve presentations:

Practice, practice, practice.

- Your audience will be able to tell if you're underprepared for your UX design presentation. That can hinder your chances of getting work.

  - Don't try to wing it. You might think you're pulling it off, but trust us, we can all see how underprepared you are.

  - If public speaking is not your skill, then practice and preparation are even more crucial.

- A good way to see how well you’re doing is to record yourself giving the presentation.

Next, talk about eye contact.

### Use eye contact strategically.

- Eye contact must be respectful and confident.
  - Research has found that three seconds is a good amount of time to look at someone.
  - Eye contact engages your entire audience and it makes you, as the presenter, seem relaxed (even if you're not.)  

- **TAs,** Slack out a link to "How long to make eye contact" for students to read at home: [https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-long-you-should-hold-eye-contact-2016-7](https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-long-you-should-hold-eye-contact-2016-7).

> **Instructor Note:** Again, pause briefly for questions.

### Use wireframes to focus on functionality, not aesthetics.

- Imagine this: You want a stakeholder to validate an early-stage design's functional requirements, but they keep asking you about colors and icon design. Argh!

- Remember: Keep wireframes grayscale!

### Use mockups and animation to aid imagination.

- It is not uncommon to have a client who knows nothing about design.
- Without a shared design language, it can be challenging to express tricky concepts and UX design rationale.

  - We know what heuristics are, but your client or audience may not be familiar with the "insider" jargon.

  - Simplify and visualize your process in your presentation, so you're using the "show and tell" strategy.

- Mockups and animation can help your client visualize and imagine how the final product is going to look.

### Hold a Q&A session at the end of your presentation.

- Q&A sessions can help to inspire, inform, and solidify knowledge imparted during your talk.

### Presentation Strategies.

**1. Expose your design process.**

- Don’t be afraid to put your raw sketches out there for the project team to see.
- When storytelling, one of the designer’s most powerful contributions is the design process.
- Exposing the design process brings your audience on the journey of how your thoughts developed.
- It’s a good idea to include at least one slide that provides some context on how you arrived at your design. That can include any deliverables that might help support your narrative and design conclusion.

**2. Prepare for common questions**

- Once you gain experience and have given a few presentations, you'll notice that similar questions arise again and again. It's helpful to prepare in advance for questions that are commonly asked. A few examples of common questions are: 
  - How did you come up with this [solution/design/approach]? 
  - Why did you decide to [design/problem solve/iterate] this way?
  - How do you know that the design solved the intended problem? 

- Every designer's answers to these common questions will vary, but what's important is to prepare your answers in advance. Do this by giving thought to the questions and practicing answering them by writing down the answers, putting them into a slide, or practice answering them aloud.

**3. Tell a story as a group.**

- Stories are much more interesting than facts because stories entertain us. Storytelling grabs and maintains the audience's attention.

**4. Ask questions at crucial moments.**

- A question breaks up your regular presentation rhythm and helps to reinforce that what you’re saying is important.

**5. Don’t read off of the slides.**

- Reading directly from a slide that everyone in the room can see (and read for themselves) is boring and makes you look unprepared.

**6. Highlight important points with visual metaphors.**

- Visual images of a scenario the audience is already familiar with help them retain points longer in their memory.

**7. Organize your presentation into three main points or takeaways.**

- The rule of three is an effective organizing principle used in many forms of writing.

**8. Share the responsibility.**

- You are a team, and each team member needs to demonstrate his or her contributions. Use an MC and make sure to introduce each team member.

**9. Consider your audience and use a pitch mindset.**

- The audience doesn't know you, and they're seeing this presentation for the first time. Consider what they're curious about.

> **Instructor Note:** Take any remaining questions.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Address any questions that were posted to Slack. You can also ask TAs to field questions on Slack. 

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** This boot camp's projects and presentations are designed to help you learn the design thinking process and build solutions in your portfolios that are employer competitive. 

Next, let's talk about how to design a case study.

## 3. Instructor Do: How to Design a UX Case Study (15 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to introduce the importance of case studies in UX/UI design and how they'll be used throughout their portfolios and other projects.

Start by engaging students with a question, then move on and walk through the components of a case study.

> **Ask:** "Has anyone checked out other designers' portfolios to study their processes?"

- Call on a few students. Have them say something about portfolios they've looked at. 

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Encourage students to share links to their favorite portfolios in Slack.

### Design portfolios:

- As a UX designer, your portfolio is the most valuable asset you have in your job hunt.
  - Companies today will not consider you without one.

What makes an employer-competitive UX portfolio?

- It tells a **compelling story**.
  - The number one reason employers 'pass' on a portfolio is "lack of explanation" and "lack of context."
    - Your case study should tell a clear, compelling story.
  - It’s most important to outline your **user-centered design process** (how the problem was solved).
  - UX portfolios should not be a retrospective of ALL of your past work.

> :gem: Designer Insight: Choose 2-3 of the Junior UX job candidate points below and share examples. Provide insight into what "proves" they are capable of taking on a junior UX role. 
>
> - Ask a TA to give examples for a couple of the job candidate qualities as well. 

- Hiring managers for junior UX design roles look to your portfolio and listen to what you say in the interview for evidence that: 
  - You are able to solve problems and think creatively.
  - You show deliverables from every step of the design thinking process. 
  - You include artifacts to show how you think: including sketches, whiteboarding, and iterations.
  - You communicate your design process effectively and with clear language.
  - You will continue to learn from and challenge the team.
  - You are someone who takes the initiative to learn what you need to know.

### How to design a UX case study:

> **Instructor Note:** As you walk through this section—how to design a UX case study—pause for questions and be sure to add helpful, professional anecdotes, too. 

- **TAs,** Slack out the links for students to review at home: 
  - [http://bestfolios.com](http://bestfolios.com)
  -  [https://medium.com/bestfolios/6-ux-design-case-studies-done-right-4bec060d719](https://medium.com/bestfolios/6-ux-design-case-studies-done-right-4bec060d719).

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Invite students to post a question about designing case studies to Slack. Another option is to raise their hands and ask questions as you lecture. 

### Consider your audience:

- Hiring managers are busy. They cannot review all of your work. 
  - Most UX and product design case studies contain too much information.
  - Curate your work.
  - A well-designed case study demonstrates your talent, skills, and describes an overview of your process.

Organize your case study. 

First, divide your case study into two parts: summary and process.

1. Summary

- **Brief summary at the top:** Describe your product and explain how it works in a few sentences.

- **Define the problem/objective:** 
The objective: 
	- gives an overview of the product
	- explains who the user is, what problem you're trying to solve, and who was involved
	- provides background information and technical details or specifications. Who is this project for? What is the challenge?

- **Define the solution.**

- **The role you played:** This is where you show off your skills—list everything you accomplished to bring this project to life.

2. Process 

- A breakdown of what you did during **each phase** of the design thinking process.

**Show your process artifacts with purpose:**

- Assets are your opportunity to show rather than tell—explain a big chunk of the process in visual form.

- Assets can take many forms, and the more diversity in them, the more engaging for readers.

  - Photographs, which can back up descriptions of on-site research, interviews, and teamwork
  - Screenshots of in-progress work and sketches showing rough ideas
  - Sticky notes and affinity diagrams
  - Wireframes, sometimes with color added for extra clarity for the reader
  - Animated gifs showing interactions

### Use labels or annotations for each asset:

- A case study without shown assets is incomplete, but one that shows assets without explaining them is almost worse. A designer should always explain the importance of assets in the process.

### Capture your process with one or three photos.

- Provide an overview of your process, but don't go into too much detail.

- Photos are essential for capturing the starting place, messy middle, and polished end solution of the creation process.

### Use motion and animation to get attention and bring your design to life.

- You can use motion capture tools like CloudApp to capture screenshots, record animations, and annotate on the fly.
- **TAs,** Slack out a link to CloudApp: [https://www.getcloudapp.com/](https://www.getcloudapp.com/).

### Show off product features while explaining your design process:

- Capture gorgeous hi-res photos of people interacting with your app.

### Write a conclusion.

- End with a conclusion sharing what you learned.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Invite TAs to join you in sharing a couple of tips on what has worked well for your own case studies. 

Next, it's time for students to dive in and get to work on their case studies. 

## 4. Student Do: Google Slides Presentation Prep and Work Session 1 (65 min)

:pushpin: **Important Point:** Now, it's time for students to begin creating their Google Slide presentations in a one-hour Work Session.

> ::globe_with_meridians: ****Online Recommendation**:** Put student groups into breakout rooms. Cut and paste a screenshot of the Deliverables slide and share it in Slack.

**TAs,** share the case study outline template in Slack: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FQC82-O3zGd6PGMCLgq3V9i7XSpD1ucJiHbZ3o4f8-Y](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FQC82-O3zGd6PGMCLgq3V9i7XSpD1ucJiHbZ3o4f8-Y)

**TAs,** Slack out the Google Slides template: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y9o1AnOyOIqkuxusijOOvJKqduXv1HL4edEDDoy230o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y9o1AnOyOIqkuxusijOOvJKqduXv1HL4edEDDoy230o/edit?usp=sharing)

**Summary**:

Students groups are preparing and practicing their presentations for the next class. Groups are designing a UX case study deck and prototype walkthrough along with dividing up presentation responsibilities and talking points.

**Instructions**:

Students will build a UX case study presentation for the Group Project 1.

1. Collaborate on a Google Slides deck.

2. Divide the presentation responsibilities and slides.

3. Create UX process talking point and prototype walkthrough dry runs as well as practice the presentations.

**Deliverable**:

In this activity and work session, students will produce a presentation deck for their Group Project 1. The deck should support a presentation lasting approximately 10 minutes and include the group's UX prototype walkthrough.

**Instructor and TAs**:

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: monitor the student groups as they work. Support teams in injecting storytelling into their presentations.

***Watch out for:*** 

- Ten minutes is not a very long presentation. Watch for groups with more than 20 slides in their deck.

- Look for groups that aren't outlining their presentation and encourage them to do so.
- Watch for "quiet" group members and encourage groups to divide their presentation responsibilities equally. 
- Be sure all group members have identified an equal portion of the case study to present.

Next, give everyone a break. (You, too!)

## 5. Break (15 min)

Everyone should take a break now.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Don't stop sharing your screen! Put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual timer will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

## 6. Student Do: Google Slides Presentation Prep and Work Session 2 (60 min)

Students should continue working on their UX case study presentation slides and wrapping up their Group Project 1 work.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation**: Put student groups back into their breakout rooms. Stay energized. Help student groups stay energized, too. Make the presentations an exciting goal that they're driving to. > **Say:** "You will have as much fun next class sharing your work with others as you will hearing how other groups present theirs!" It will be a fun day.  

***As students work:***

- Stay engaged! You and the TAs should actively observe and engage with students throughout the entire day—no "hiding" behind your slide deck or off-screen.

***Watch out for:***

- Help students limit "deck creep." ***A 10-minute presentation should be 10-15 slides and must not exceed 20 slides, with 30 seconds spent on each slide.***
- Be sure that students add talking points.
- Remind students to review the tips for building case studies as well as presentation tips.
- Have each team practice their presentation.  

Next, students will sign up for their presentation time slots. 

## 7. Instructor Do: Group Project 1 Presentation Signup (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to schedule the presentation lineup.

**TAs,** Slack out the Google Drive Presentation Itinerary:

- [Presentation itinerary template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uKNK9uleEljCdXxBII1ubmKn2zwKGrhlm2DVZ1IFNiM).

First, review the Presentation Itinerary with the students.

Next, have students sign up for their presentation time slots. 

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. 

Next, take a few minutes to set up the folder that will contain all the student presentations.

## 8. Instructor Do: Group Project 1 Presentation Folder (5 min)

Take the following steps to ensure that all students are clear on where to upload their presentations.

1. Create a Class Google Drive folder for Group Project 1 Presentations.
2. Share the folder with your students via Slack. 
3. **Each group must upload their presentation to the folder** **BEFORE NEXT CLASS**. Students will not be allowed to work on their presentations during the presentation day.

**Remind** students to practice their presentations. 

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** This is a good moment to empathize that even experienced designers who failed to practice their presentations stumbled from lack of preparation and rehearsal.

Take any questions, then move on to wrap up tonight's class.

## 9. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)

Congratulate students! They are nearly ready to present their work! 

- Recap what students worked on today.

  - Wrote a case study outline for your Group Project 1 presentation. 

  - Built a UX Group Project 1 case study in Google Slides.

  - Prepared for oral presentations.
- Take a moment for the teams to report on the level of completeness of their Group Project 1 and presentation.

> **Instructor Note:** Address questions.
>
> - If students have questions that are best addressed after class, invite them to stay online for office hours. 

***Before the next class:*** Students must upload their presentations to the class Good Drive folder.

- Thank everyone for doing their best work.
- Remind students that you are staying online and available for office hours for the next 30 minutes.
- Have a good night!
