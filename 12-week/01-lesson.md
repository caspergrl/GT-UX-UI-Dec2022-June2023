---

## Instructors and TAs: Please take the midcourse Instructional Staff Survey

Trilogy Education values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. In order to know where we need to grow, we must ask questions. ***Your candid input truly matters to us.*** You are a vital member of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we would appreciate your feedback at the following link if you have not already taken the midcourse survey: [https://forms.gle/CW7kMdvShs4kUpxB8](https://forms.gle/CW7kMdvShs4kUpxB8).

## Overview

In today's class, students build on their UI skills by practicing advanced interaction design. Students will create the hero space of a webpage, add animation, and then run usability tests on their classmates' experience.

Lessons 12.2 and 12.3 will continue to build on students' interaction design skills through augmented reality and smartwatch design, as well as by thinking through and testing a prototype of a multimodal experience.

*Unit 12 wraps up the UI portion of the UX/UI Boot Camp.*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Define interaction design and its connection to the future of voice user interface (VUI), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR).

2. Apply the 12 principles of motion from *The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation* to the hero space of a webpage using Figma/Adobe XD.

3. Articulate the rules of animation through Figma/Adobe XD.

4. Design an animated prototype for usability testing.

5. Execute a usability test of a hero space animation with Figma/Adobe XD.

## Class at a Glance

- Welcome to Lesson 12.1 on UI interaction design and testing. You've reached the halfway mark!
- Unit 12 is the *last* UI unit for the UX/UI Boot Camp before getting into Group Project 2.
- Today's class is about interaction and motion design. It is divided into four parts:

  - Part 1 will introduce hero space interaction.
  - Part 2 will cover animation.
  - Part 3 will teach transitions.
  - Part 4 will explain motion usability testing.

- By the end of today's class, students should gain confidence in building advanced, high-fidelity UI prototypes and making their interfaces sing through transitions and animations.

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: 🌐) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom Gallery View: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activites and reviews by doing some activities together as a class instead of creating breakout groups. 

## Preparing for Class

Review the slides for the lecture: [12-week/01-slides/12.1-UI Interaction Design + Testing Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X_g7UTmLd3B0dJM2Ha73Br9v_DoD2BUQzOT-RzoR-aY).

Note the portfolio case study at the start of your discussion.

If you're new to animation principles, read the following before class:
  - [https://uxplanet.org/disneys-motion-principles-in-designing-interface-animations-9ac7707a2b43](https://uxplanet.org/disneys-motion-principles-in-designing-interface-animations-9ac7707a2b43)

Prepare to give the software demo:
- Adobe XD Auto-Animate (Section 11)
- *Important:* Familiarize yourself with the software and demo in advance, so when you give it to the class, you can modify the Adobe XD source.
- Before class, run through the Adobe XD animation sample. Practice with Adobe XD animation, familiarize yourself with the interaction panel, and know how to change the trigger > action > easing > duration drop-downs.
- Review this Adobe blog for more help: [https://theblog.adobe.com/auto-animate-how-to-create-automatic-animations-xd/](https://theblog.adobe.com/auto-animate-how-to-create-automatic-animations-xd/).

**Weekly Challenge**
There isn't *new* challenge to assign this week; students should continue to work on their Challenge Units 11/12 assignment.
  - Encourage students to complete their government agency UI case study.

> **Instructor Note:** If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Office Hours: Reviews and Practice (45 min before class)

> **Instructor Note:** Encourage your students to make the most out of class and not to be afraid to ask questions.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Advanced Prototyping and Today's Objectives (2 min)

**Welcome students to class.**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Start with a quick one-minute engagement tactic to get the class started with something fun, mindful, kinetic, or icebreaking. Why? It helps build community, gets class started on a high note, and focuses your students.

- Congratulate students on reaching the halfway mark of the boot camp!

  - By the end of this unit, they will have completed both the UX and UI portions of the boot camp.

- Invite students to reflect on how much they have learned. Even if the pace feels uncomfortably fast, they've absorbed a tremendous amount about the design thinking process. And they've completed a project to put into their portfolios!

> :gem: **Designer Insights:** Share a quick example of working on your portfolio.

> **Instructor Note:** Invite two to four students to briefly share what skills they're most proud of thus far in their UX or UI education.

- Now, launch the slides for the lecture: [12-week/01-slides/12.1-UI Interaction Design + Testing Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X_g7UTmLd3B0dJM2Ha73Br9v_DoD2BUQzOT-RzoR-aY).

  - **TAs:** Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.

  - UI design will continue to get harder, so they should continue practicing at home.

- Preface today's objectives by letting students know that you'll cover the benefits of including animation in their UI.

- For example: Did you know that the YouTube play button contains an animation that converts from a play button to a pause button? Go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and play and pause any video to illustrate this small animation. Be sure to put the video on MUTE. 

  - While you'll be showing students how to use Figma/Adobe XD for transitions and animation features, Figma/Adobe XD are different from animation programs like Adobe After Effects or Principle for Mac. These programs are more complicated and give designers higher levels of control over animation design.

- Put today's learning into context and give students a mindframe to best understand advanced prototyping. For example:
  - The advancements in mobile apps forms. 
  - A UI can be learned faster by your users if you use animation and transitions effectively.

**Connect today's learning.**

- Connect today's lesson to UX to help students see how deep their knowledge is becoming and how the UX portion of the boot camp connects to UI. For example:
  - In UX, our role is making a great user experience that is usable, useful, accessible, and delightful. Today we will practice using advanced prototyping and animation to improve user experiences.
  - Prototyping, a UX skill, allows us to validate concepts as we refine the user experience. Today we will use high-fidelity prototyping and animations to improve our UI work.

**Review today's learning objectives.**

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for any questions before launching into the day.

## 2. Instructor Do: Portfolio Case Study (3 min)

:pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal in this brief lecture is to align your students on the value of creating case studies for their government agency redesign projects.

- Share the case study challenge and discuss the key points:
- Complete your government agency case study for your portfolio.
- Students will turn in their Unit 11 Challenge this week.

Now discuss the future of technology and the role of UX/UI design in that future.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** To best answer student questions, jump out of presentation view to grid view so that you can quickly answer any student questions. If there are too many questions, ask students to stay for office hours.

## 3. Instructor Do: UX/UI Future (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to introduce students to how UX/UI designers think about the future of design and the implications for user experience (UX) and interaction. This supports today's first learning objective, defining interaction design's connection to the future of VUI, AR, and VR.

You'll start by summarizing the state of UX/UI and where it's headed. Ideas to emphasize: How UX/UI is uniquely positioned to address future needs, how user experience drives innovation with the adoption of new technologies, and how UX/UI considers users' interaction in the near and far future.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, you will be at the tip of the spear. Your ability to address innovations in technology, changes in culture, and new opportunities for your users makes you extremely valuable to employers. Students should add "innovation strategies" or "future casting" to their resumes and LinkedIn skills profiles.

*"You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."*
  
## SLIDE 6
Speculative design is a design method addressing big societal problems and looking toward the future—and creating products and services for those scenarios. Design for the future is speculative.

- Doing speculative design often requires starting with research where you attempt to identify "signals" of emerging technologies and trends, then seek out weaknesses in those technologies and experimental uses. Brainstorming ideas and forming a story around a solution would follow.
- We don't often have an opportunity in our day to day as designers to do this type of exploration but it can be a really fun and inspiring activity.

## SLIDE 7
Software-based UX and UI design are new professions and require these 4 skills:
- Critical thinker: solving problems - we need to be able to analyze ideas, concepts and data collected from different perspectives, then arrive at an unbiased solution. We need to attempt to ancitipate the consequences of certain actions in advance. We need to be able to reflect, think indepdently, stay objective and problem solve. We have to be discliplined but also flexible.
- Communicator: understanding and communicating ideas
- Collaborator: working with others
- Creator: producing high quality work

## SLIDE 8
- The world changes fast and technology is always striving to lead it. Considering what may be next will help you keep you role (currently AI and ML are popular topics). This job requires being a lifelong learner.

## SLIDE 9
Stay on top of trends and technological developments. Anticipating the innovations in the market and the ever changing needs of users will help. Always learning, always reading, always listening to podcasts, attending conferences, talks and networking, getting and receiving feedback on our designs.

## SLIDE 10
- Review the Peter Drucker quote. 
  - Peter Drucker was celebrated by *Businessweek* magazine as “the man who invented management. Not necessarily a "designer." 

## SLIDE 11
- Global design company IDEO defines "innovation" as solutions that consider the domain of user experience.
They see innovation as being at the intersection of desirability, viability, and feasibility...  
  - Emotional innovation
  - Progress innovation
  - Design thinking
  - Experience innovation
  - Functional innovation

Applying innovation can be big or small.

Innovation is not always something radically new like the introduction of the iPhone in 2007; innovation can be an efficient solution, an experience that supports a user emotionally, or a solution that is useful to differently-abled people (hearing or visually impaired). 

Innovation is an industry "buzz word," so be wary of self-proclaimed "innovative software teams" because sometimes they are the most unlikely to be innovative in their design.

3 near future opportunities (here now but still progressing):     
- Voice user interface (VUI) (amazon echo, google nest, siri)  
- Virtual reality (VR) (vr headsets)  
- Augmented reality (AR) (pokemon go, museum tours, even wine bottles)  
Consider design thinking as a set of principles still applicable to each of these opportunities.

#### Challenges
A challenge is one of the most compelling game elements that motivate people to take action.
  - Example: Video game levels are an example of challenges.
  - **Ask**, "What is a good example of a video game with challenges?"

## SLIDE 27
#### Points or Scoring
Points allow users (players) to measure their success. Many games use a points system.
   - Example: Rewards programs
   - **Ask for a show of hands:** "Anyone use an app that keeps score?"

## SLIDE 28
#### Badges or Stickers
Rewards can become additional drivers of motivation. Everyone wants a gold star!
   - Your user can be motivated by more than just informative content; they respond to sounds, badges, or gold coins.
   - **Ask**, “Anyone remember getting stickers in grade school? Welcome to social engineering.”

## SLIDE 29
#### Leaderboards
Not many things can motivate users more than the desire to be the leader.
   - Humans are competitive; allowing your users to "win" will improve interaction.
   - **Ask for a show of hands:** “Anyone use Nike Run or Peloton?”

## SLIDE 30
#### Journeys
The user should feel that they are starting a personal journey that allows them to learn the UI along the way.
   - Example: Quests and scavenger hunts have been keeping humans busy for millennia.
   - **Ask**, “What is an example of a quest?”

## SLIDE 31
#### Time Constraints
Time ticking down can make users react faster and motivate them to take action right here and now.
   - Time is the ultimate decider in games. From sports like speed skiing, where winning can be separated by 100ths of a second, to Rubik's Cube challenges, getting the quickest time motivates players.

**Summary**

- Students will be working off of a prebuilt user persona (Greg).
- Help students quickly get out materials and consider a desktop hero space interaction using a gaming strategy for Greg.
- Students work alone, then get into breakout rooms of 2.

**Instructions**

In this activity, students work independently and then in breakout rooms with a partner. Partners will share feedback on their designs, working through some high-level layouts.

**Instructor and TAs**

Set a timer for 20 minutes.

Move from screen to screen with your TAs to make sure students are quickly defining a brand, choosing an interaction or game strategy, and starting to sketch.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Pop into the breakout rooms with your TAs. Encourage your class to use Slack and to use Zoom's raised-hand feature for questions.

- Extend the activity time, if needed.

**Deliverable**

Students will post their hero space design sketch or Figma/Adobe XD design in Slack.

## SLIDE 36
## 8. Instructor Do: Hero Space Interaction Activity Review (10 min)

Close the breakout rooms, bring everyone's attention to your screen, and lead a review of the hero space design activity.

- Remind everyone to place their sketches (or screen grabs from Figma/Adobe XD) into Slack.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Sharing your screen, scroll through the work posted to Slack, then choose two or three pieces of work to review with the class.

- > **Ask:**
  - "What do you notice about these hero spaces in general?"
  - "What do we see in all these layout interactions?"

Choose a design and dialogue with the student who created it.

- > **Ask:**
  - "What game strategy was used here?"
  - "Is this game strategy the best choice? Why or why not?"

Repeat this process with the remaining student examples.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions before moving into the next lecture section.

Now that students know how to apply game design ideas to the hero space, you can show them how animation can be added to the hero space, too.

12 principles of animation from the classic book *The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation,* by Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas.

## SLIDE 39
### The 12 Animation Principles
1. Squash and stretch:
    - Objects respond to gravity, mass, weight, and flexibility.

## SLIDE 40
2. Anticipation:
    - Informs the viewers about what’s going to happen.

## SLIDE 41
3. Timing:
    - The more frames, the smoother and slower the animation.

## SLIDE 42
4. Slow-in and slow-out (known as easing):
    - Most of the objects in the real world follow motions which are eased.

## SLIDE 43
5. Staging:
    - Staging directs the attention toward the most critical objects in the scene.

## SLIDE 44
6. Arc:
    - A ball thrown from a height follows a parabolic path. Arcs make moving elements feel more natural.

## SLIDE 45
7. Highlight secondary action:
    - Animation can be used to support or enhance the primary action of an object.

## SLIDE 46
8. Exaggeration and appeal:
    - Specific actions can be exaggerated to gain more attention.

## SLIDE 47
9. Follow through and overlapping action:
    - Overshoot a position before coming to rest in order to make them feel more natural. It is known as bounce animation.

## SLIDE 48
10. Straight ahead action and pose to pose:
    - Straight ahead action scenes are animated frame by frame from beginning to end.
    - Pose to pose involves starting with drawing a few key frames and then filling in the intervals later.

## SLIDE 49
11. Solid drawing:
    - Solid drawing adds good form and a three-dimensional feel to an animated work.

## SLIDE 50
12. Appeal:
    - It is established before anything moves by choosing visuals and type that have potential.

We have wrapped up the interaction and animation portions of the lesson. This means that students have accomplished their first three learning objectives for the day: defining interaction as it relates to the future of VUI, AR, and VR; applying the 12 principles of motion using Figma or Adobe XD; and articulating the rules of animation.

Next, you'll move into the transitions section of the lesson.

### UI Transition Best Practices

The following six best practices are important to designers because transitions can be very helpful when working with lots of content or multiple pages of a design system.

**1. Responsive:**

- Works between screens but also responds to the user.

**2. Associative:**

- The transition connects content and functionality, like a play button transitioning into a pause.

## SLIDE 62
**3. Fast:**

- A slow transition can be misunderstood as a mistake.

**4. Natural motion (easing):**

- Transitions should change in an arc.

## SLIDE 63
**5. Clear:**

- The user should understand why elements are transitioning.

**6. Intentional iteration:**

- Animations should be A/B tested and improved over time.

## 16. Student Do: Hero Design Transition Challenge (30 min)

**TAs:** Slack out to students the following Google Doc activity file: [12-Week/02-Activities/12.1/12.1-03-Transition-Challenge-Activity-Google-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c6DqMoDOL3NIKu_8vm0wQTP0Riml3k9XTbGtUxhDYz4).

**Summary**
Students will work alone and practice creating quick solutions for screens.

- Students will work from their sketches from the previous activity.

**Instructions**
Working alone, students will iterate their design, then add a transition using Figma or Adobe XD.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Be sure all students share their screens while they work. If you notice students doing great work, use the spotlight feature to focus briefly on their work and ask the student to talk about their process with the class.

**Instructor and TAs**
Set a timer for 30 minutes.

Navigate student screens with your TA to make sure students are quickly defining transitions and to help struggling students.


**Deliverable**
Students will upload their prototype transition videos to Slack.

## SLIDE 68
## 17. Instructor Do: Hero Design Transition Challenge Review (10 min)

Call attention back to your screen and remind everyone to place their Figma or Adobe XD prototypes into Slack.

- Scroll through the transition solutions posted in Slack and lead a review of two or three students' work you select from Slack.
  
- > globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Share your screen; alternatively, the student whose work you're discussing can share their screen.
  
- **Sample questions to stimulate the review:**
  - "Tell us which strategy you used for this transition. Why?"
  - "Does anyone see something they find confusing or that could be iterated?"
- Invite a student to give feedback on their classmate's work.
- Repeat this process for remaining one or two students.

> **Instructor Note:** Invite questions.

Remind students that if they want more feedback on their transitions, they should stay for office hours.

Next, you're going to talk about components and how a component approach makes it easier for designers to work across devices responsively.

### Scalable Components Are a Building Kit

- We are responsible for helping define the animation for our experiences as part of designing solutions that are scalable for our users. This happens alongside maintaining and designing the UI style guide and should be designed together.

  - Think of your UI as a kit or parts like IKEA furniture: pieces and components that can be assembled into a variety of webpages using the same assets.

  - Work on top of scalable systems.

## SLIDE 71
### Scalable Components

Scalable components are UI elements like cards, UI forms, navigation, buttons, etc. that are built for scale. They are worth testing because they are solutions built to be deployed to your users.

  - Consider building on top of an existing UI framework as it is faster to develop and faster to get solutions to market.

_Review how animation can scale as well._  
  - Consider how and where your UI differentiates itself from its competitors.
  - UX/UI takes time to make excellent! Start small and improve over time.
  - Quickly discuss MailChimp's launch animation.

- Animation rules are part of the UI style guides.
  - Example from real life: Consider the millions of email campaigns MailChimp helps manage. The design and animation experience is part of their brand.

## 19. Student Do: Figma/Adobe XD Hero Experience Animation Testing Activity (15 min)

**TAs:** Slack out to students the following Google Doc file:
[12-Week/02-Activities/12.1/12.1-04-Animation-Testing-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_qZAzO_KxQA51jVnNVww4eZpeyfIfT7uJqYMLjrIVVI).

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, your ability to build and test high-fidelity prototypes will be part of your job and being able to refine your user experiences and include animations will make you more employable. Add these iterations to your portfolio, and add these skills to your resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

**Summary**

- Students will work in small groups.
- Students will practice testing transition solutions for screens that challenge their ability to create animations and transitions quickly.

**Instructions**

Small groups of students will practice testing and iterating design layouts with animations and transitions.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Put students in breakout rooms of three or four students. Assign roles to keep students testing their prototypes efficiently. Assign who is testing first, second, third, and so forth.

**Instructor and TAs**

Set a timer for 15 minutes.

Navigate between breakout rooms with your TAs to make sure students are productively testing their solutions.

*For groups that struggle with this activity:* Assist students in using the remote control features in Zoom. Help students who struggle with sharing prototypes in Figma.

**Deliverable**

Students will post videos from their tests, notes, or iterated solutions in Slack for review.

## 20. Instructor Do: Figma/Adobe XD Hero Experience Animation Testing Activity Review (5 min)

Close the breakout rooms and call attention back to your screen.

- Remind students to post their prototypes to Slack.
  
  - Share your screen while you scroll through the work they've posted.
- Choose the work of one or two students to discuss.
- Call on a team to share their UI prototypes.
  
- > globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Share the featured student's work on your screen or ask them to share their screen for this discussion.
  
- **Possible questions to ask:**
  - "What did you want the user to do with your homepage?"
  - "What value does this homepage have for the business?"
- Discuss a few others.
- Ask a couple of students to critique their classmates' work.
- Repeat this process for another student, or two, if time allows.
