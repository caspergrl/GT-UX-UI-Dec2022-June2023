# 12.3 Lesson Plan: Multimodal Prototyping

---

## Overview

Today's class wraps up Unit 12 as well as the UI section of the UX/UI Boot Camp. During this lesson, you will help students build on their skills in UI prototyping and interaction design by guiding them through testing a prototype of a multimodal experience as well as supporting their thinking processes.

*Today is the last day of the UI portion of the UX/UI Boot Camp. Students will use all of the skills they've acquired over the past 12 weeks to execute today's activities.*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Articulate use cases for multimodal solutions in UI design.

2. Execute a UX scenario and storyboard for a multimodal experience.

3. Add voice commands to a multimodal Adobe XD prototype (only).

4. Design a multimodal Adobe XD prototype for usability testing.

5. Execute a usability test using multimodal prototypes in Adobe XD.

## Class at a Glance

Welcome to Lesson 12.3 on multimodal prototyping. It is divided into three parts:
  - The first will cover multimodal UX scenarios and storyboarding.
  - The second will explain multimodal paper prototyping.
  - The third will teach Adobe XD design and multimodal usability testing.

Section 6 has a demo on Adobe XD voice interface prototyping.

By the end of today's class, students should gain confidence in building advanced multimodal UIs and making their experiences more complete.

## Instructor Notes

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom Gallery View: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activities and reviews and do some activities/reviews as a class instead of creating breakout groups.

## Preparing for Class

Review the slides for the lecture: [12-week/01-Slides/12.3-Advanced-Multi-modal-Prototyping Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xuIhwWtYfAXM4aGELsOO3jftuQ1VoonkhfROonRWEqM).

You'll give a 10-minute demo today on Adobe XD voice interface prototyping (see Section 6).
  - To prepare, run through the demo before class.
  - Also, read this article on using voice triggers and speech playback to interact with prototypes: [https://theblog.adobe.com/introducing-voice-prototyping-in-adobe-xd/](https://theblog.adobe.com/introducing-voice-prototyping-in-adobe-xd/).

At the end of class, you'll announce Project Weeks and Group Project 2. **Prepare in advance to create teams (groups of three):**
 - Work with your teaching assistants (TAs) to create teams for Group Project 2.
    - Give thought to team selections in advance.
    - Create teams that will produce substantive projects.
    - Place stronger students with weaker students, provided you think they can get along.
  - ***Note:*** Don't allow students to select their own teams to avoid the schoolyard team effect (i.e., choosing only their friends).

This class is activity-heavy, so model enthusiasm during your two short lectures on multimodal experience design and voice user interfaces (VUIs). During the activities, offer to help students so they can get through the entire paper-to-clickable prototyping process successfully.

If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Lastly, keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [12-Week/04-Time Trackers/12.2-Time Tracker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YsSUc5lFJn8HwEOmWTCx7lrgNLpvRBuLO4nlAqml1wY).

- Use an online timer to manage in-class activities. Google Chrome has one: [Stopwatch & Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stopwatch-timer/eoiibkbchfmgmhlodifjceiginokllbj?hl=en).

## Office Hours: Reviews and Practice (45 min before class)

>  **Instructor Note:** Encourage your students to make the most out of class and to ask *questions*.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Multimodal Prototyping and Today's Objectives (2 min)

Open up the slides for the lecture: [12-week/01-Slides/12.3-Advanced-Multi-modal-Prototyping Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xuIhwWtYfAXM4aGELsOO3jftuQ1VoonkhfROonRWEqM).

**TAs:** Share a pdf of the slides with students via Slack.

Congratulate students on making it to the final day of the UI portion of the boot camp!

> **Instructor Note:** Take a moment to get a pulse check from the class.
>
> **Ask:** "How is everyone feeling so far? Does anyone have any wins to report?"
>
> - Some examples of "wins" are: I updated my LinkedIn resume for the career services milestone, I learned a new trick (how to make great gradients) with Figma, or I got 8 hours of sleep.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Start class with a quick digital warm-up or engagement strategy.


**Connect today's learning.**

- Connect today's lesson to skills that students acquired during the UX portion of the boot camp. For example:
  - Throughout UX and design thinking, we have been preparing to solve complicated problems. Today we will practice working with complexity and thinking through a user's experience across multiple devices.
  - As a UX designer, your ability to focus on your user and have empathy for their needs means meeting users *where they are*. Nevertheless, it also means considering providing them with a seamless experience between their interactions and a device/software.

- Get students into a mind frame that will help them grasp the concept of multimodal design and how it enables users to interact via multiple inputs.
  - For example, you could talk about verbal and nonverbal communication, pointing out that how humans communicate is not limited to talking back and forth, but extends to gestures, tone, body language, and eye movements, too.
- Tell students that they will use all of the skills and tools they have learned during the UI weeks. For example:
  - We will be considering our users' needs as they move through the world and interact with multiple devices.
  - Let students know that today will be a hands-on class in which they will create multimodal prototypes.

**Review today's learning objectives.**

> **Instructor Note:** Pause to take questions.

## 2. Instructor Do: Multimodal Experience Design (15 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Our goal is to define multimodal design and push students to consider a broader UX across multiple devices and contexts. This ties into the first learning objective, articulating use cases for multimodal solutions in UI design.

First, you'll give examples of multimodal design, define it, and finish with some real-world examples so that students can start thinking about how to apply and expand their UI skills to include multimodal interfaces.

Start by pointing out that "multimodal" simply means "many ways." For designers that means giving the user many ways to interact with a device, app, site, or brand.

Then, give a brief example of a multimodal experience that you had this morning:

- For example, this morning I used my voice to ask Alexa to play a podcast on my kitchen speaker, then I used my hands to keep listening when I headed out for a walk.


## SLIDES 1-4
Review

## SLIDE 5
"Multimodal" simply means "many ways." For designers that means giving the user many ways to interact with a device, app, site, or brand.

Examples of multimodal experiences:

- Nike+ (shoe, phone app, and desktop)
- Peloton (bike, treadmill, TV, and app)
- Netflix (phone, tablet, and TV)
- Mac iOS (Apple TV, macOS, iPhoneOS, watchOS, arOS, and vrOS)
- Tesla (CarOS, desktop monitoring, and app)

- Multimodal human-computer interaction engages with the virtual and physical environment through natural modes of communication (visual, acoustic, and tactile).
- *Multimodal* interactions are more "free and natural" because they simulate real-life verbal and nonverbal communication. In contrast, *monomodal* interactions are limited to only words (text) or sound (a recording).

## SLIDE 6
- Multimodal design combines multiple modalities (visual, acoustic, and tactile) to improve a product's UX. 
    - Examples: MacOS and Siri, Sonos apps (mobile/tablet/desktop), or Roku remote and voice search.
- Multimodal UX/UI design addresses the user *where they are*—on a jog, commuting to work, on a train, on a hands-free device, etc.
- Multimodal design takes a user's location and activity into account. For example, once a user returns home from their jog, they may switch from hands-free to typing on their device's screen.

## SLIDE 7
Multimodality approaches users through a variety of channels such as speech, gesture and eye gaze as well as text, graphics, sound avatars and voice synthesis.

Where there may be challenges with learning styles and preferences, multimodality by it's nature of using multiple channels and methods can ensure everyone can use it.

For folks with special needs, it can help with accessibility and equity.

And when considering 21st century methods of learning, mutimodality can provide an enriched learning process through matching the content delivery wit hthe best moda of learning for the student.

## SLIDE 8
### Multimodal Is Multisensory: The Five Senses

Multimodal UXs involve multiple human senses:

**1. Sight:** All the screens we view at banks, gas stations, phones, monitors on airplanes, etc.

**2. Hearing:** Notifications, music, errors, success messages

**3. Touch:** Our keyboards, trackpads, screens, and other components

**4. Taste:** Nothing ... yet!

**5. Smell:** No, Smell-a-Vision isn't available yet.


> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note**: As a UX/UI designer, you are expected to consider the broader context of your user. Like Don Norman says, "UX is how you experience everything—it's bigger than just a screen or an app." Being able to articulate use cases for multimodal solutions in UI design *will make students more competitive*. Students can add multimodal experience design to their resumes or LinkedIn skills profile.

## SLIDE 9
### Multimodal Design Considers a Variety of Senses

Multimodal design is where physical awareness and digital awareness meet. Imagine an app that can sense how you move, the temperature of the air, or even the tone of your voice.

**Proprioception** is a person's awareness of his or her body and its movement. Proprioception is why we lean in the opposite direction when we're thrown off balance—to steady ourselves.

**Magnetoception** is the sense of one's position based on the Earth's magnetic field. Salamanders, toads, turtles, and homing pigeons use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate.

Fun fact: In 2019, researchers reported evidence suggesting that humans have magnetoception.


## SLIDE 10
### Interfaces Rely on Sense

We anticipate UIs will interact with a greater variety of our senses (e.g., not just a tap on a screen but *how hard we tap*).

Questions??

## SLIDE 13
Review

## SLIDE 14
Multimodal design lets us use products together seamlessly to accomplish tasks, such as:

- *Search and discovery* uses voice to search the web, to set a timer, or to find a recipe or directions.
- *Health and healthcare* integrates medications with devices and wearables that monitor biological functions.
- *Internet of things (IoT)* products are designed to reflect how humans interact with physical objects and appliances (e.g., lights go on/off based on a user's presence).

## SLIDE 15
### Voice Commands

Amazon, Google, and Apple have the leading voice-activated smart speakers on the market:

- Amazon Echo currently connects with the most devices.
- Google Home provides the most accurate search results.
- Apple Siri has the best sound, and users can send texts via voice.

## 3. Student Do: Multimodal UX Scenario and Storyboard Challenge Activity (20 min)

**TAs:** Slack out to students the following Google Doc activity:
[12-Week/02-Activities/12.3/12.3-01-Multi-modal-UX-Scenario-Storyboard-Activity-Google-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11UIHyowYxFbmC-Rfgl92azCMi5VP8fGPa6-jl74DfGY).

**Summary**

In this activity, students work in teams of three and create user personas, UX scenarios, and storyboards. Their mission is to consider how a multimodal experience makes a delightful experience across multiple modalities.

> **Instructor Tool Note:** In a physical class, groups use pen and paper to collaborate on these deliverables. For online, encourage students to use online tools. For sketching quickly, recommend Figma (use of the pencil tool), Miro, or InVision Freehand.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Create breakout rooms and assign roles for each student in each group:
> - Facilitator: One student creates and shares a collaboration file.
> - Instructions keeper: One student pulls up the activity and reads to the group.
> - Timekeeper: One student keeps an eye on the time to make sure they get through each part of the activity.
> - Keep one group in the main Zoom room to keep recording useful for students.

**Instructions**

- Set a timer for 20 minutes.

- Put students into breakout rooms of three people.

- Have students quickly define a user, choosing the multimodal devices and interactions, and working through their scenarios and storyboards.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Pop into breakout rooms with your TAs. Encourage your class to use Slack and to use Zoom's raised-hand feature for questions.

- Extend the activity time, if needed.

**Deliverable**

Students will share their group storyboards via Slack.

## SLIDE 19
## 4. Instructor Do: Multimodal UX Scenario Storyboard Review (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal is to quickly review the UX scenarios and storyboard experiences and explore the options of multimodal solutions.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Check in with groups. If they need more time, reduce review time. Bring all breakout rooms back to the main room and lead a review of the storyboards.

- Aim to review two to three storyboards.
- Choose a storyboard from Slack to review.
- **Questions to stimulate discussion:**
  - "Why was this strategy in particular used?"
  - "What would you do differently?"
  - "Could additional modalities be used to make this more multimodal?"
  - "What can we learn from this design?"

With this activity, students have accomplished the second learning objective, executing a UX scenario and storyboard for a multimodal experience.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note**: As a UX/UI designer, your ability to tell a story about how a user interacts with multiple devices throughout their day is key to demonstrating that you understand how to solve problems across multiple experiences. Add multimodal user stories and scenario design to your resumes and LinkedIn skills profile.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for any questions.

Now focus on a particular aspect of multimodal design: voice.

## SLIDE 20
Review

## SLIDE 21
1. **Language**: It represents a UI as words that can be turned into commands.
2. **Natural processing**: Voice commands substitute for physical affordances. Users should be able to control aspects of the UI naturally.
3. **Voice controls**: Voice commands are specific and require learning. The user understands what a UI system can do; they can verbalize control commands in that system.

Voice prototyping is a unique feature to Adobe XD, which makes it valuable to know how to use multiple prototyping tools. At some point, Figma might add this feature, but for now, using Adobe XD is just as useful.

## SLIDE 22
## 6. Instructor Do: Demo - Adobe XD Voice User Interface Prototyping (10 min)

Demo how to create voice commands in Adobe XD prototype by walking students through the supplied Siri voice command sample (link below).

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Share your screen and talk about how you are using the software (e.g., "I'm moving my mouse over the prototyping tab in the upper left and selecting...").

> **Instructor Note:** Let students know that the voice feature in Adobe XD is Adobe's competitive advantage over other UI tools.

Your mission is to quickly show off the voice commands in Adobe XD and get your students excited about the possibility of prototyping with voice commands.

- Make the demo quick, so the student teams will have plenty of time to practice.

**Demo Instructions**

1. Download the Adobe XD file:
  - [12.3-Apple-Watch-Voice-Prototype.xd](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DaAWtjdtkx2MqZ9_Ost4lWf3BBA07EPH)

Review

## 14. Instructor Do: Recap and Wrap-Up (5 min)

Call the class back to attention.

Quickly review today's key concepts.

- > globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Have students use the hand-raising feature in Zoom.

Start by asking students to volunteer a definition of multimodal design. 
  - *Answer:* Multimodal human-computer interaction is "interaction with the virtual and physical environment through natural modes of communication," including visual (sight/eye gaze), acoustic (speech/voice/auditory), and tactile (gesture/touch).

Ask students to provide three to five examples of senses or perceptions that are used with multimodal UI—use cases. 
  - *Answer:* sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell

Ask for some examples of voice interfaces.
  - *Answer:* Siri, Alexa, car interfaces, Google, etc.

Quickly review a few concepts covered in the UI units.
  - *Choose concepts that you know your class would benefit from reviewing.*

Take questions. Encourage students to stay for office hours.

## 15. Instructor Do: Group Project 2 (5 min)

It's time to introduce Project Weeks (units 13-15). Generate excitement about shifting gears into hands-on work, which will begin next class.

For the next three weeks, we're working on our second group project: the redesign of a nonprofit website.

In a nutshell:
  - This will be a three-week group project that culminates in a UI prototype presentation and portfolio-ready case study.
  - Students will work in teams of three (or four) students.
  - Each team will choose a nonprofit organization as their "client." From there, they'll execute the UX and UI design thinking process, creating a high-fidelity responsive web design (RWD) solution all the way through to a clickable UI prototype.

**Say:** "We'll cover the requirements in depth at the start of the next class."

Announce the group selections (which you have decided on in advance):
  - Students will be working in groups of three.
  - Have students gather into their groups of three and exchange phone numbers and contact information.

## 16. Instructor Do: End Class (2 min)

We did it! You did it!

- Take any remaining questions.
- Tell students that they will need to use the skills they just practiced for the rest of their UI careers—so it's essential to keep practicing.
- Invite students who want feedback on their work to stay after class for office hours.

Wish everyone a good night.
