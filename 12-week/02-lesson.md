# 12.2 AR and Smartwatch IxD

---

## Overview

In today's class, students will continue to build on their interaction design (IxD) skills by learning about augmented reality (AR) and smartwatch design.

In Lesson 12.1, students built on their UI skills with advanced interactions by designing the hero space of a webpage, adding animation, and running usability tests. The next class, Lesson 12.3, will continue to build on students' interaction design skills by identifying and testing a prototype for a multimodal experience.

*Unit 12 wraps up the UI portion of the UX/UI Boot Camp.*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

1. Build a paper or digital prototype for AR.

2. Build and test a paper prototype for a smartwatch.

## Class at a Glance

- Welcome to Lesson 12.2 on AR and smartwatch IxD.
- Today is an activity-heavy day.
- The lesson has two key topics:
  - Topic 1: AR. This topic includes one lecture and one 40-minute activity in which students will build an AR prototype.
  - Topic 2: Wearables and smartwatches. This topic includes one lecture and one three-part activity that runs 55 minutes in total.

## Instructor Notes

üåê **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students‚Äô feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom Gallery View: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.‚Äù
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: ‚ÄúBear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.‚Äù

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine the activity and review sections by doing some, or all, of the activities together as a class instead of creating breakout groups.  

## Prepare for Class

Review the slides for your lecture: [12-week/01-Slides/12.2-AR+UX-Smartwatch-IxD-Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18t7T6_83al8laDcBKTh-2V6rJQXCSxENnA600JyWj1U).

> :gem: **Give thought to your Designer Insights:** As you review the lecture slides, think about a few anecdotes and professional stories that you can share in class to support the discussion about AR and smartwatches.

Review the activities in advance as there are two lengthy activities:

  - AR prototype (40-minute activity)
  - Smartwatch paper prototype (55-minute activity, in three parts)

This is the *final push* before students move into Group Project 2, so plan in advance to generate a feeling of urgency and encourage students to learn everything they can *this week* before they shift gears into their UI group projects.

Plan to reinforce the importance of spending significant time outside of class, up to 20 hours, practicing the skills you're teaching. Students' time in class isn't nearly enough to prepare them for work in UX/UI design.

If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have teaching assistants (TAs) consult the [12-Week/04-Time Trackers/12.2-Time Tracker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iKszYCrx2Gf1KpF3LQCIOm3GLqNWGD7b8KYp_dpRE4Q).

- Use an online timer to manage in-class activities. Google Chrome has one: [Stopwatch & Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stopwatch-timer/eoiibkbchfmgmhlodifjceiginokllbj?hl=en).

---


## Office Hours: Reviews and Practice (45 min before class)

> **Instructor Note:** Encourage your students to make the most out of class and not to be afraid to ask questions. Remind students to utilize office hours for questions at key points during class, like after you've taken questions at the end of a lecture or activity reviews.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome | The Future of UI and IxD (2 min)

Welcome students to class and open the slides: [12-week/01-Slides/12.2-AR+UX-Smartwatch-IxD Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18t7T6_83al8laDcBKTh-2V6rJQXCSxENnA600JyWj1U).

**TAs:** Share a pdf of the slides with students via Slack.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Engage the class! Start with a warm-up to keep the energy high and kick off the class.

- Generate excitement about the challenge of designing for AR interfaces and smartwatch form factors. Some ideas:
  - Using AR to identify social distancing rules.
  - Designing smartwatch apps to encourage good posture or helping users stay active.
  - Apply smartwatches to paying for products without having to interact with kiosks or cashiers.

- Remind students that even professional designers are continuously learning new tricks. For example:
  - Figma was not even a company until 2012. New software tools are always cropping up as technology evolves.
  - We might have bendable or even foldable hardware in the next five years, which means new UI design opportunities for the UX/UI community.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share about a "new trick" that you recently learned yourself. Feel free to invite a TA to share, too.

**Connect today's learning.**

- Connect today's lesson to concepts from the early weeks in UX to help students appreciate the depth of their knowledge and the intersection of UX and UI. For example:
  - During the UX/design thinking weeks, we explored ways to use our human-centered design skills to solve problems for existing technology. These skills can also be used to explore future-facing solutions for nascent technologies.
  - Just because the technologies are new doesn't mean we can ignore our human-centered foundation. In today's class, we will extend empathy for users new to certain technologies.

**Review today's learning objectives.** 

Now that you've generated some excitement about the future of UX/UI design and its intersection with cutting-edge technologies, dive into an explanation of AR.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for any questions before diving into the lesson.

## 2. Instructor Do: AR IxD (20 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** The goal of this section is to discuss the future of UX/UI and IxD. This lecture supports the first learning objective, building a paper prototype for an AR app.

Here you will give students an overview of AR. It's a wide topic, so stick to focusing on using your current experiences to project into the future the foundations of usability and user-centered prototyping. The key ideas to emphasize are:

## SLIDE 13
AR is a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thereby creating a blended or composite view.

It combines real-life input, stimuli, or environs with computer-generated ones. 

Often confused with VR, which entirely replaces the world, AR just augments the world.

AR adds digital elements to reality to create something new. 


## SLIDE 14
While often used these days for social media, there are no limitations to what could be possible.

## SLIDE 15
AR can manifest itself in several different interfaces. The following are common acronyms for some of them:

- **GUI** (graphical user interface): Interacting with data through graphic and visual indicators (e.g., pressing ‚ùå to cancel).
- **HUD** (heads-up display): Interacting with data layered over a fixed transparent display (e.g., guides on a vehicle backup camera or advanced goggles).
- **VUI** (voice user interface): Interacting with data through voice or speech (e.g., asking Siri to set the alarm).
- **FUI** (future user interface): A future-facing interpretation or speculation of how we might interact with computers or manipulate data physically (e.g., *Iron Man* interface and computer robot collaboration).
- **TUI** (tangible user interface): User interface data influenced by interacting with the physical world (e.g., tracking your daily steps with a Fitbit).

The early definition of these experiences makes it easy to scope the content that needs to be produced. Testing is a crucial part of the design process. Understanding the focus of each experience will allow you to produce testing plans early and often.

## SLIDE 18
### AR Design Patterns
#### 1. Color

A commonly used color for text, icons, and guides is white. Some applications have additional gradients in the header and footer to make fixed elements more legible.

## SLIDE 19
#### 2. Contrast
In AR, we are essentially layering data over a live camera feed. We have no control over what the camera shows and have to design accordingly. It is good practice to preview and test the interface over a variety of background images and videos as the design evolves.

## SLIDE 20
#### 3. Blend Modes
Taking a cue from video games, designers can wander beyond opaque and transparent UI and consider adding blend modes to their graphic elements. This method will allow the user to still see parts of the background without completely obstructing the view. Blend modes also might reduce the visual weight of a fixed element.

## SLIDE 21
#### 4. Layout and Position

Fixed elements are usually situated on the top and/or bottom of the screen. Having fixed elements lets the user focus on the center of the camera and composition.

- Additional prompts and elements that do not focus on content remain close to the bottom (e.g., carousels and additional options).

## SLIDE 22
#### 5. Typography
Text is usually treated as a caption or a label and is sans serif since it is easier to read.

- Text is most often in white or yellow, unless on a background color.
- Text usually has an opaque or semi-opaque container to improve legibility.
- Text without containers is treated with soft shadows and/or a subtle stroke.

## SLIDE 23
#### 6. Iconography
White is the most common color for text, icons, and guides. Some applications have additional vignettes or gradients in the header and footer to make fixed elements more legible.

- Brand colors are used sparingly or not at all when in the camera view.
- System colors outside of the brand colors may be used to reference errors, warnings, or completed states (e.g., red warning when getting too close).
- We usually reserve opaque colors for the call to action buttons or features such as triggers that might be obscured by the user's hand.

## SLIDE 26
Design patterns for interactions are also emerging. Language plays a critical role when defining your experience. In AR, there are five main types of content for designing interactions:

1. **Static:** Content that is still and lacks movement and interaction.
2. **Animated:** Content that moves on a timeline or follows a sequence.
3. **3D:** Content with width, height, and depth, or data with XYZ coordinates.
4. **Dynamic:** Adaptive content that changes with interaction or over time.
5. **Procedural:** Content generated automatically or algorithmically.

### Static and Locked in Space
Although these elements are locked in space, they could have a dynamic feature where they always face the user. This design convention is useful for labels and materials that need to accompany an object or marker in space.

### Static and Fixed on Glass
This interaction has a static graphic overlay fixed to the glass (screen) at all times. This design convention is useful for permanent elements that need to be within the user's reach at all times. An example of this is a menu or return prompt.

## SLIDE 27
### Dynamic 3D and Proportionate in Space
This is helpful when allowing a user to see an object in an actual environment with lighting and measurement considerations. They are often used in commerce platforms.

### Dynamic 3D and Flexible in Space
A great way to engage with 3D models and to understand their components is by using 3D to encourage interaction. For example, a 3D cube could have six different controls based on what is turned to the user. This is most commonly used for educational purposes and understanding the breakdown of an object.

### Adding Content
How an object gets introduced into space can set the pace for the rest of the experience. Form always follows function. If a 3D knob animates to its volume position before playing sound, the speed of the rotation is then an indication of volume.

- Designers ask themselves the following questions about AR:
  - *Should the content automatically place itself in the environment?*
  - *Or should the user place the content manually?*

## SLIDE 28
### Indicators

Indicators range from minimal to complex and animated.

- Use placement indicators to call out areas where a user can place content.

- How the indicator is visualized can help solve several tasks at once.

- For example, a square indicator is a strong pattern since it references the angle and perspective of the ground plane.

- Indicators are most often in white, yellow, blue, or a low opacity black.

- Indicators are dynamic and adjust accordingly. They also are not persistent and disappear when an action has taken place.

## SLIDE 29
### Snapping
Snapping refers to automatically aligning or referencing a guide. It is similar to everything having a weak magnetic force that gets stronger the closer it is to another magnet. Below are some examples:

- Snap to the object (e.g., a couch aligns to the edge of a table).

- Snap to the environment (e.g., a couch sits evenly on top of a rug).

- Snap to the guide (e.g., we center a table in the middle of a rug).

## SLIDE 30
### Rewards and Alerts
Rewards motivate users to continue a story, move on to the next step, or complete an achievement. Alerts can grab their attention when they are facing the wrong direction.

- It is essential to have significant moments and actions visualized in a way that considers the whole environment (e.g., confetti exploding everywhere after an achievement).

## 3. Student Do: AR Prototype Activity (40 min)

**TAs,** Slack out the following instructions and keep them open during the activity:
[12-Week/02-Activities/12.2/12.2-01-Augmented-Reality-Prototype-Activity-Google-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1St7e6u2MQdC4PUWRCz9wqb0ePSHmQgexQFCGksnnB_A).

**Summary**

- Students will practice creating solutions for screens that challenge their ability to solve a problem in a new medium *quickly*.
- Students will work in breakout rooms of two to four people (even numbers).

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Establish roles in each breakout room and assign a leader/facilitator student who is setting up the shared workspace in Figma. Each group member should work/sketch on the same file to make sharing easier.

**Instructions**

1. First, students will work independently and sketch a wireframe for an AR feature for a cooking app.
2. Next, they'll trade feedback with a partner.
3. Finally, students will independently create a clickable prototype from it with Figma or Adobe XD.

**Instructor and TAs**

Set a timer for 40 minutes.

This is a long activity, so keep the energy high!

- How to keep the energy high?

  - Before entering their breakout rooms in Zoom, have everyone put their hands forward in a virtual hand pile, say "1...2...3...Break!" and then everyone raises their hands up high.
  - Share a playlist in Slack with a high-energy song for work time.
  - Ask: "Who is excited to prototype for the future?! ...LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!"

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Navigate between student breakout rooms with your TA to make sure students are quickly considering AR options. Encourage your class to use Slack and to use Zoom's raised-hand feature for questions.

*Possible trouble spots for students*: Help students define the AR interaction in their Figma or Adobe XD Prototype. Encourage starting on paper or quickly wireframe ideas.

**Deliverable**

Students will post their paper prototypes or Figma or Adobe XD solutions for feedback in Slack.

## SLIDE 34
## 4. Instructor Do: AR Prototype Activity Review (10 min)

Close the breakout rooms and share your screen for the review process.

**Open and review the solution file with the class.**

Solution file: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w7jvqUDRYSXwzKMpgjdxEiS5HlB0aGli](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w7jvqUDRYSXwzKMpgjdxEiS5HlB0aGli).

- > **Say:** "At a higher level of fidelity, this is the type of solution we're looking for."

**Walk through the students' prototypes.**

Remind students to post a photo of their sketch or a link to their paper prototype in Slack.

- Aim to review the work of one or two students.
- Choose a file from Slack and open it.
- Ask the student to share their screen and walk through their process.
- Ask one of their classmates to provide a critique sharing one thing they like and one thing they'd do differently in this prototype.

**Ask a TA to provide a critique:**

- Select another prototype from Slack for the TA to critique.
    Ask:
    - "What is one thing you like about this prototype?"
    - "What is one thing you would do differently?"

**Provide your own feedback on the prototype:**

- What is one thing you like about this prototype?
- What is one thing you would do differently?

> **Instructor Note:** Pause for questions. You'll be moving on to smartwatch design after the break, so be sure to address any AR-related questions now.

Remind students to use office hours for additional questions or feedback from you on their AR work.

Give everyone a break before moving on to the next section on smartwatches.

Review

## SLIDE 38
Much like AR, wearable tech and smartwatch technology best practices are in their infancy. There are no clear-cut tools or approaches. A lot of the work is highly experimental.

Wearables were primed to become a fifty billion market by 2022 and are expected to reach 72 billion in 2023.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As UX/UI designers, your ability to create solutions and think through new screen modalities quickly will make you more employable. This is because it shows you have a wider range than your colleagues who only work on desktop websites. Your ability to build and test a paper prototype for a smartwatch should be included in your portfolios or as skills on your resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

## SLIDE 39
### Wearables
Wearable technology has a variety of applications that grow as the field itself expands.

- "Wearables" are a category of electronic devices that can be worn as accessories or embedded in clothing.

- Wearables appear prominently in consumer electronics with the popularization of the smartwatch and activity tracker. Apart from commercial uses, wearable technology is being incorporated into navigation systems, advanced textiles, and healthcare.

## SLIDE 40
### Smartwatches
Like smartphones, smartwatches use touchscreens, offer apps, and often record your heart rate and other vital signs. The most popular operating systems are Apple‚Äôs WatchOS and Android‚Äôs Wear OS.

### Apple Watch Guidelines

There are a few considerations to focus on as you try to design a smartwatch app.

**Increase speed:** The 2016 benchmark for interaction with a smartwatch was 2 seconds. According to analytics, Apple showed in its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) that the average user interaction time with its smartwatch was between two and five seconds. Always try to provide content to the user as fast as possible. It is crucially important on smartwatches compared to other platforms.

**Be direct:** A couple of taps should do it.

**Glances and notifications:** These are the foundation of the watch and provide for actionable live data.

**Apps:** Apps must be holistic with increased cohesion between devices.


## SLIDE 44
#### Layout

- Avoid displaying too much information onscreen at once.
  - Create visual groupings to help users find the information they want.
  - Use the full width of the screen.

## SLIDE 45
#### Color
  - Use black for your app‚Äôs background color.
  - Be aware of color blindness and how different cultures perceive color.
  - Avoid using color as the only way to show interactivity.

## SLIDE 46
#### Optimize
Optimize your asset files. Using PNG-8 instead of PNG-24 helps decrease the file size significantly. Another thing you can do is add a black background instead of leaving it transparent.

## SLIDE 47
#### Progressive Loading
If you need to load heavy content like photos or maps, in the meantime, show the user the rest of the content. Don‚Äôt block the whole screen just because you‚Äôre waiting for the photo to load.

## SLIDE 48
#### No Back Button
On the iPhone and iPad, we used to have both title and back label at the top of the screen. The watch does not have enough space for both, so Apple decided to leave only the screen title that the user is currently looking at.

## SLIDE 49
#### Type
Apple has two different fonts for mobile and desktop and for the watch. The San Francisco font family has a Compact version for the watch. Compared to the regular version, it has more free space between characters, which makes it legible at small sizes.

## SLIDE 50
Review

## SLIDE 51
#### Padding
How close the content is to the edges in Adobe XD, Figma, and Sketch documents will bother your eyes when designing for a watch. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the Apple Watch has a hardware bezel that will add natural padding to the app.

## 7. Student Do: Part 1 | Smartwatch Prototype Activity (25 min)

**TAs:** Slack out the following Google Doc. Keep the file open during the entire three-part activity:
[12-Week/02-Activities/12.2/12.2-02-SmartWatch-Prototype-Activity-Google-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_y5nhVsTgK1wKKx6e_nER6sJiSilGCyi-d7yKcAiCO8)

> ***The activity instructions include parts 1, 2, and 3.***
>
> A review of all three parts will follow at the end.

**Summary**

- Students will practice creating solutions for screens that challenge their ability to design a solution in a new medium quickly.

- Help students define the watch interaction in their Adobe XD, Figma, or InVision Prototype.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Students are working independently. However, TAs can set up the Zoom breakout rooms for one-on-one student support or help. Students can work in the same breakout rooms during all three parts of the activity.

**Instructions**

In this three-part activity, students will create a paper prototype for a smartwatch.

In Part 1, students will select an app to be the basis for their smartwatch design and they'll sketch a paper prototype with three to five screens.

**Instructor and TAs:**

Set a timer for 25 minutes.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Navigate the students' breakout rooms with your TAs, listening for any issues, hesitation, or questions. Make sure students are quickly considering smartwatch options. For example:

- Size and critical information on the screen.
- What the user is doing with the smartwatch: shakes, buzzes, and haptic feedback should be considered. 

**Output**

Students will create a paper prototype with three to five screens. *Work will not be shared until Part 3 is completed.*

## SLIDE 56
## 8. Student Do: Part 2 | Smartwatch Prototype User Test Activity (10 min)

**Instructions**

In Part 2, students will test their paper prototypes.

Set a timer for 10 minutes.

**Instructor and TAs**

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: As you navigate the breakout rooms, be on the lookout for students who are struggling with the following:

- Sharing their experiences or not yet adding enough information to make the screens clear to use.
- Sharing screens that are too zoomed out, or talking about the big picture but not sharing specifics.

**Output**

Students will take notes, photos, and videos of the paper prototype testing process. *Work will be shared once Part 3 is completed.*

## SLIDE 57
## 9. Student Do: Part 3 | Smartwatch Prototype Iteration Activity (20 min)

**Instructions**

In Part 3, students will iterate their prototype and create digital wireframes.

Set a timer for 20 minutes. Post a breakout room warning at 15 minutes that rooms will close in 5 minutes.

**Instructor and TAs**

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: As you navigate the breakout rooms, be on the lookout for students who are struggling with the following:

- Watch out for students trying to go "high fidelity in 20 mins" and help them prioritize their iterations to be about addressing the feedback for their quick user test, rather than highly polishing the visuals.

- Help students connect their screens in prototype mode, which will make their experiences on the watch clickable.

**Deliverable**

Students will share their paper prototypes, testing notes, and digital wireframes, clickable prototypes via Slack.

## SLIDE 58
## 10. Student Do: Smartwatch Prototype Review (15 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Post a breakout room warning that rooms will close in 5 minutes. Close the breakout rooms and bring everyone's attention back to your screen in order to lead a review of the smartwatch prototyping activity.

- Remind students to post a photo of their paper prototype or a link to their clickable prototype in Slack.
- Share your screen.
- Choose an interesting prototype from Slack to review.
- Review the work of one to three students, as time allows.

**First, ask the student designer to speak.**

- Have the student whose work you selected describe their thinking process.
  
  - > :globe_with_meridians: Ask these students to share their screen.

**Next, call on a student to offer a critique.**

- Ask a student from a different group to tell the class one thing they like, and one thing they would do differently about this prototype.

**Then, ask a TA for feedback.**

- What is one thing you like about this prototype?

- What is one thing you would do differently?

**Finally, provide your own feedback.**

- What is one thing you like about this prototype?

- What is one thing you would do differently?

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions before wrapping up the class.

Remind students who want feedback on their prototypes to stay after class for office hours.

Now it's time to wrap up today's class.

## 11. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (4 min)

As a wrap-up, help students retain what they learned today with a recap of today's concepts.

**Review concepts and reinforce learning.**

Help students anchor today‚Äôs lesson by asking them to raise their hands‚Äîor post answers in Slack‚Äîand reply to the following:

- Ask a few students for their definition of AR.

  - *Answer:* Augmented reality---from context-aware apps to AR glasses.

- What are the six AR design patterns?
  - *Answer*: 
    1. Color
    2. Contrast
    3. Blend modes
    4. Layout and position
    5. Typography
    6. Iconography

- What are some AR interactions?
  - *Answers*: static, animated, 3D, dynamic, and procedural interactions.

- What are some of the guidelines for the Apple Watch?

  - *Answer*: List would include increase speed, be direct, glances and notifications, apps must be holistic, layout, color, optimize your asset files, progressive loading, no back button, type, and padding.
