# 10.1 Lesson Plan: Fundamentals of Interaction Design (IxD)

---

## Overview

In today's class, students will learn about the fundamentals of interaction design (IxD), designing for the interaction between users and systems. Our goal is to enable students to capture interaction inspiration for future use, improve user behaviors through interaction dimensions, and prototype micro-interactions in Figma/Adobe XD. Today, students will add mental models, habit loops, and micro-interactions to their UI and visual design knowledge.

In Lesson 10.2, students will deepen their UI skills through an understanding of atomic design principles and hands-on work building wireframes and mockups. In Lesson 10.3, students will build their UI skills by learning the value of buttons and designing a mobile UI form prototype. All together, Unit 10 enables students to develop their web prototyping skills through knowledge of high-fidelity responsive UI prototypes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Identify examples of IxD principles and micro-interactions on a site or app.
2. Describe IxD's five dimensions.
3. Identify three micro-interactions that show effective IxD and create a GIF of all three with GIPHY Capture.
4. Design and prototype a micro-interaction using Figma/Adobe XD.

## Class at a Glance

Welcome to Lesson 10.1 on the fundamentals of IxD. Today's class is about IxD. It is divided into three parts:

- Part 1 will introduce IxD and its dimensions.
- Part 2 will cover mental models and micro-interactions.
- Part 3 will teach habit loops.

By the end of today's class, students should have gained confidence in building UIs and be comfortable with all the interactions associated with an interface.

## Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: 🌐) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

🌐 **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. If you find that you are running short on time, feel free to combine activity and review sections and doing each activity as a class instead of creating breakout groups.  

## Preparing for Class

Review the slides for today: [10-Week/01-Slides/10.1-UX-Fundamentals-of-Interaction-Design-Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-Q3Tq-86pCvDDfwVKr6ZxgKPn4cP1kukqjtrw8ww0JU).

Be sure to read through the entire lesson plan, slides, student activity files, and the Time Tracker—and make notes so that you’re thoroughly prepared to teach and support students.

Also, read through this week's challenge so that you can summarize it effectively at the end of class.

Practice this lesson's demos in advance so they run smoothly during class:
  - GIPHY Capture Demo (Section 8)
  - Micro-interaction in Adobe XD Demo (Section 13)

Today will be very hands-on and team-oriented. Work with your TAs to keep the energy high and help students stay focused on their prototypes.

Students will want to create polished work, but remind them that they can learn everything they need to know by creating lower-fidelity prototypes.

Be sure to:
- Encourage students to take advantage of office hours to get feedback on their work.
- Share UI resources and encourage students to practice.

If needed, review the Strategies for Class Online in the unit README.

## Class Video

- [Class Video:](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=18be130e-e825-4e34-b905-aa9000e7184d) Watch a sample video of this class being taught by Holly Reynolds.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [10-Week/04-Time Trackers/10.1 TimeTracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TYGONOKS4TiUiLJjdmDcLsi6eLQsYEHvKwj9CvB26cc/edit?usp=sharing).

- Use an online timer to manage in-class activities. Google Chrome has one: [Stopwatch & Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stopwatch-timer/eoiibkbchfmgmhlodifjceiginokllbj?hl=en).

---

## Office Hours: Reviews and Practice (45 min before class)

Encourage your students to use office hours. By the same token, encourage them to make the most out of class by asking questions, which has benefits for their classmates.

---

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Today's Objectives (5 min)

- Open up your slides for today's lecture: [10-Week/01-Slides/10.1-UX-Fundamentals-of-Interaction-Design Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-Q3Tq-86pCvDDfwVKr6ZxgKPn4cP1kukqjtrw8ww0JU).

  - Make a PDF copy and share it in Google Drive for class. Share slides in Slack.
- Tell students that UI design will continue to get harder. This is a boot camp. You and the TAs are here to help along the way.

  - Remind students: Your growth will be astounding, and it will take work.
- Next, tell a story to prime students' minds for getting the most out of today. Try to draw a parallel between IxD and the physical, analog world—but without getting into the definition of IxD (for now). For example:

  - Tell a story about how you interacted with someone this morning—maybe a parking lot attendant, a customer service rep, a Starbucks associate, etc.

  - Invite one to two students to share an interaction they had while getting something done today or in the past week (in person or on the phone).

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Help students relate what IxD means for their future careers by sharing how it plays into your own work.
>
> - Alternatively, invite a TA to share about how IxD plays out in their work.

**Review today's learning objectives

- Now, put today's learning in the context of the boot camp. Talk about how what students learned in the early weeks of studying UX will come into play during today's lesson. For example:
  - A key aspect of UX is solving the problem right through the ideation > prototyping > testing cycle. Today we will grow our UI prototyping skills through interaction design.
  - UX is about infusing empathy into solutions and caring about your user. Today we will actualize those human-centered ideas into interaction habits through UI prototypes.
  - UX is about building both the macro and the micro of a user's experience. Today we will focus on growing our micro-interaction experience.
- Finally, walk through today's objectives.

## 2. Instructor Do: What If Discussion (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to help students grasp IxD by reflecting on what helps humans successfully interact with websites and apps.

Here you'll draw from what you and students just shared about "interaction" in real life. This time, invite students to imagine how an *app-based interaction* might play out in real life. Invite them to pretend that they are at a grocery store:

**What is a UI style tile?**

A one-page, bite-size design guide that includes fonts, colors, and interface elements. Style tiles capture the essence of brand visuals in a condensed form.

- Designers refer to the work of others to make their work easy, and so can you. Building a robust style guide starts with a simple UI style tile template.

Style tiles are a great exercise in visual design and will help you to get to grips with how things like colors, shapes, and various other assets mingle together in your designs.

**When do designers use a UI style tile?**

- Developing as a starting place before defining any high-fidelity prototypes or mock-up screen executions.
- Develop and produce with the help of visual designers to establish rules and consistency within a UI.

**Why do we use a UI style tile?**

- A UI style tile allow for experimentation.
- Can help build cohesion and consistency to a digital product’s UI and experience.
- Style tiles are easily shareable and quick to produce.

**Instructor and TAs:** Be sure to circulate and suggest ways that students can enhance, arrange, and design their UI style tiles. Encourage them to have *fun.*

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students work individually, rather than in groups. Keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. If students need more time, you can shorten the review.

**Summary**

This activity gives students practice with UI style tiles by gathering and designing iconography for their government website.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Help students start with the template and work on adding things they have already made decision about. Their color palette, their logo, etc.

*For students who finish early*: Shouldn't be an issue, but this style tile is also part of the challenge so progress in class will reduce work at home. Encourage iteration.

**Instructions**

While working in groups of two to three, students are going to create a UI style tile in Figma/Adobe XD that includes a color palette, typography, images and patterns, and icons/iconography.

**Deliverable**

Students will submit their UI style tile as a .png export of their Figma/Adobe XD artboard.

## SLIDE 10
## 14. Instructor Do: UI Style Tile Challenge Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention and lead a review of students' UI style tiles.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, stop sharing your screen and ask a student to share their screen instead. Once they are finished, ask them to stop sharing so you can reshare your screen.

Remind the volunteer to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen.

- Aim to review the work of two to four groups.
- Ask students to explain their rationale behind their design choices.
- Open the room for feedback on the students' work.
  - *What works well?*
  - *What could have been done differently?*

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about UI style tiles. For example:

  - "A UI style title is the only way to create a style guide." *False.* There are literally endless ways to design a style guide, but why work so hard! Using templates and tools to speed up your decision-making is essential to being good at your job.

  - "UI style tiles aren't helpful when actually designing" *False.* Style tiles can be helpful in speeding up your experimentation and layout executions rather than always designing from scratch. Do not design from scratch for every screen—it's far too slow!

### IxD Defined

A term was invented by Bill Moggridge of IDEO and countless others in HCI and software designer to alleviate unpleasant user-system interactions. IxD is a process in which designers focus on creating engaging web interfaces with logical and thought-out behaviors and actions.

- IxD is a subset of UX design, along with countless other professions. By "countless" other professions, we mean the job roles for UX/UI/FE dev are constantly changing. There might be new job titles like "service designer" or "AI Prototyper" but fundamentally, they are using similar skills.


## SLIDE 13
### Interaction Designers

An interaction designer is the person on the design team who helps form and create a design strategy, identifies critical interactions of the product, creates prototypes to test concepts, and stays current on technology and trends that will impact users.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, you will be expected to work with interaction designers or take on these roles in your job as you produce solutions. Being able to speak to the ideas IxD applies to solutions will go a long way toward securing a role in UX/UI. Add interaction design to your resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

## SLIDE 14
Interaction Design (IxD) is the design of interactive products and services in which a designer's focus goes beyond the item in development to include the way users will interact with it. Thus, close scrutiny of users' needs, limitations and contexts, etc. empowers designers to customize output to suit precise demands.

## SLIDE 16
### IxD Considerations

There are five primary considerations in IxD. (By "consideration," we mean factors you as a designer should build into the layers of your interface.)

- **1. Human/machine communication:** At its most fundamental, IxD serves to translate the conversation between the technology and the user.
- **2. Action/reaction:** Not surprisingly, the action/reaction dynamic of interactive media sits at the heart of IxD. IxD requires the designer to understand and anticipate how interactions unfold over time, designing for the full range of permutations that can occur.
- **3. State:** As part of its role as translator, IxD is also concerned with ensuring the user understands the current state of the application.
- **4. Workflow:** In addition to facilitating the completion of discrete tasks such as selecting a payment method, IxD is also concerned with the achievement of multitask goals, such as browsing, selecting, and purchasing an item.
- **5. Malfunction:** As with all forms of communication, misunderstandings and mistakes occur. Therefore, it is also part of the designer’s role to anticipate and mitigate those problems, ensuring that both the user and the system can quickly recover.

- **TAs:** Slack out to the #resources channel: [https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/interaction-design.html](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/interaction-design.html).
  - Students can review the link at home.

## SLIDE 17
Ask the following to help shape how the design comes together:
- What **commands** can a user give to interact with the interface?
- What about the **appearance** gives the user a clue about how it functions?
- What **information** do you provide to let users know what will happen before they perform an action?
- Do **error messages** provide a way for the user to correct the problem?
- Are there constraints to help prevent errors?

## SLIDE 18
- What **feedback** does a user get when an action is performed?
- What is the **response time** between an action and a response?
- Are the interface elements a reasonable **size** to interact with?
- Are edges and corners strategically being used to locate **interactive elements**?
- Is **information chunked** into a few items at a time?

### Introduction to IxD's Five Dimensions

Interaction designers utilize all five dimensions to consider the interactions between a user and a product/service/interface in a holistic way. Specifically, designers use them to help envision the real-world demands of a user group concerning design that is not yet introduced.


## SLIDE 22
#### 1D - Words
Words used in interactions.

- Buttons, labels, taxonomy, etc.
  - This dimension represents the nature and semantics, or meaning, of a user’s interactions.
  - **Ask,** "What are some words we see in interfaces?"
  - Answer: Common words associated with the actions a user takes: submit, share, download, search, filter, checkout, save, delete, favorite, etc.

## SLIDE 23
#### 2D - Visuals

Graphic elements:

  - Icons, typography, images, etc.

  - This dimension refers to the visual design elements that are not words within a product.

  - **Ask,** "Are words more important than graphics?"

    - Answer: No, but they should work together as they both build an interface.

## SLIDE 24
#### 3D - Physical Objects or Space

User context of use:

  - Where and when, etc.

  - This dimension defines the tangible means of control, such as a computer keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, joystick, games controller, keypad, voice, or other.

  - Oftentimes, we are designing an interface on a screen to mimic the physical. Our products define the rules of these controls.

    - **Ask,** "Are there any interfaces that don't have a physical object?"

      - Answer: None—even voice UI requires a microphone in an Alexa device.

## SLIDE 25
#### 4D - Time

Motion and sound play a crucial role over time.

  - Animation, video, sound, etc.
  - This dimension is when the user interacts with and makes use of the first three dimensions. Time also encompasses sound, film, and animation, each representing another means of conveying information and enhancing the UX.
  - **Ask,** "Has anyone ever used an interface that has a lot of latency (delay)?"
  - Answer: Some older cable company set-top boxes and remote controls had this latency issue. Trying to use the grid keyboard with the up and down arrows was painful.

## SLIDE 26
#### 5D - Behavior

How users interact and perform actions:

  - Triggers, habits, etc.
  - The final dimension includes action, operation, presentation, and user reaction as user feedback from the first four dimensions. Behavior is driven by habit and can be reinforced through repeated interaction.

  - **Ask,** "How many of you think your interfaces are manipulating you?"
  - Answer: Yes, an interface is manipulating a user; however, the question remains whether that manipulation is for the *benefit* of the user or not.

**TAs:** Slack out to the #resources channel [https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-five-languages-or-dimensions-of-interaction-design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-five-languages-or-dimensions-of-interaction-design) for students to explore at home.



IxD is something we, as UX/UI designers, need to think about deeply. Why? Because it enables us to design solutions that respond to our users to create an experience. The human and the computer interact to solve a problem together.

## SLIDE 27
_Review IxD Dimensions then_

- What is the sound an email makes? Whoosh. Right? Or, "You've got mail." These are examples of interactions with a computer software that are designed with the five dimensions as part of their interaction behavior.

- Why did Zoom beat Skype or Google Chat? The interaction tool effectively captivated users and created habits.

**Support students:** Work with your TAs to ensure pairs are catching everyday web tasks, such as buying products, registering, creating a profile, searching, saving, rating, watching, etc.

**Summary**

In this activity, students are either writing on paper or a whiteboard or completing the Five Dimensions template provided. They will analyze the five dimensions of IxD: words, visuals, physical objects, or space, time, and behavior.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Interaction dimensions are sophisticated relationships. With TAs, mix into groups and have students start with a list of behaviors first and focus on behaviors that have more straightforward affordances—e.g., delete, share, open, close—before more complex ones like folding, combining, reordering, etc.

*For students who finish early*: Shouldn't be a problem, but have them help their group members until the activity is over.

**Instructions**

Working in groups of two to five, students will download and fill out the Five Dimensions template or use a whiteboard or a piece of large paper for their work. Students should work from left to right, starting in the Behavior column, to complete all five dimensions. For the visuals column, they should sketch visuals that reflect each of the interactions.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Get students into Zoom breakout rooms in groups of two to five people and assign TAs to the groups. If students need more time in the activity, you can reduce the review time.

**Deliverable**

Students will share a link to their spreadsheet via Slack. If they took photos of their sketches, they will upload those to Slack as well.

## SLIDE 31
## 6. Instructor Do: IxD's Five Dimensions Activity Review (10 min)

- Call the class back to attention to review IxD five dimensions.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** End breakout rooms and call everyone back into the main Zoom room.

- Aim to review the work of three to four student teams.

> **Ask:**

"What did you learn about UI interactions?"

"What was something you didn't consider in your interactions?"

- Pull up a set of IxD sketches and share:

  - One good sample with all five steps of interactions.
  - One sample that's incomplete or insufficient.

> **Ask:**

"Who can provide a constructive critique?"

- Encourage students to discuss what they like and what could be done differently.

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they apply five dimensions of Ixd, for example:

  - Start with the behavior you want your user to do first and then work backward into the words and then the visual. For example:
    - Behavior = Share
    - Words = Connect your friends
    - Visual = Holding hands
    - Time = Short and long
    - Object = Phone/camera
  - Review a student sample that has a strong affordance and is more obvious. For example, a Delete behavior. Then move to a not-so-obvious behavior like jealousy.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about the five dimensions. For example:
  - "If you get the five dimensions right, you have a great product." *False.* Interaction design is hard and you need to constantly test it on your users.
  - "Interaction design is nice to have rather than essential." *False.* You can use default interactions on a webpage or software solution, but it is missing what makes great experiences. We sweat the small things to make our user experiences great!

>:gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a personal story about learning and/or working with the five dimensions of IxD.

Discuss why UI designers have to "sweat the small stuff"—if we don't, the users' experience will suffer.

We have wrapped up the first part of today's three-part lesson. You covered IxD and its dimensions. Students have achieved the first two learning objectives for the day: to identify IxD principles in action on a site or app and to be able to describe IxD's five dimensions.

> **Instructor Note:** Let your class know they've done a great job so far!

Next up, you will dive into IxD principles, mental models, and micro-interactions.

## SLIDE 34
In the field of UI design, a mental model refers to how users think something should work. A mental model is a representation of what the user has in mind.

Adding mental models to your designs makes them more user-friendly and intuitive. An example is the URL field at the top of a Chrome browser, which evolved to become a search field. Why? Because the mental model users have in their minds is that a long bar on a browser window is something to type search terms into.

## SLIDE 35
### Mental Models — Skeuomorphic Design

Skeuomorphic refers to the design concept of making items resemble their real-world counterparts (e.g., the calendar on your phone has the squares and numbers of a wall calendar).

When Apple was first designing apps for iOS, they used the concept of skeuomorphic design to recreate physical objects in the digital space. It's self-evident when we look at the original iteration of the notepad app for Apple devices.

- **TAs,** slack out to the #resources channel [https://medium.muz.li/skeuomorphic-design-a-controversial-ux-approach-that-is-making-a-comeback-a0b6e93eb4bb](https://medium.muz.li/skeuomorphic-design-a-controversial-ux-approach-that-is-making-a-comeback-a0b6e93eb4bb) for students to read at home.

- > **Ask:** What do you expect to happen when you use a car's gear shift?
- **A costly mistake:** Fiat tried to reinvent the gear shift. It led to a tragic death, and the company lost millions of dollars. They had to recall 1.8 million vehicles because their design didn't take into account their users' mental models.


## SLIDE 37
- **Engineers or creators of products versus users:** Creators and users have different thought models. A good interaction designer understands *both.*

### Five Tenets of Goal-Driven Design
Alan Cooper popularized goal-driven design in his book, *The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity.*

- Cooper defines goal-driven design as a design that holds problem-solving as the highest priority. The goal-driven design focuses first and foremost on satisfying the specific needs and desires of the end-user. Today, some of the points Cooper brings up seem obvious since designers rarely select interactions based solely on development constraints. However, at its heart, the methodology is all about satisfying the end user's needs and wants, which is just as necessary today as it ever was.

1. Design first, program second
2. Separate responsibility for design from responsibilities for programming
3. Hold designers responsible for product quality - ALSO, as a part of this, more companies are expecting designers to hold product and engeineers accountable for product quality. 
4. Define one specific user for your product to start - most products have at least a few core user types bu tyou should start with one to keep your focus on the early adopters and those most likely to benefit primarily.
5. Work in teams of two - in other words, be collaborative! Don't work in a silo!


**TAs:** Slack out to the #resources channel [The Inmates Are Running the Asylum/dp/0672326140/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=uxbo09-20&linkId=52189db31293c4003c0cba3200dbb868](https://www.amazon.com/The-Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum/dp/0672326140/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=uxbo09-20&linkId=52189db31293c4003c0cba3200dbb868) for students to add to their UX libraries for later reading.


## SLIDE 42
The following are goal-driven design principles that define how a user is driven to do something (their goal):

- **1. Visibility** is the basic principle that the more visible an element is, the more likely users will know about it and how to use it. Equally important is the opposite: When something is out of sight, it’s difficult to know about and use. If the user cannot find it, it does not exist. It must be made clear as a bell what actions are possible in a UI in less than a microsecond (e.g., labeling icons as a best practice). We’ve seen a shift in major apps like Facebook away from hamburger menus and back toward tab-bar menus to improve the visibility of their essential experiences.
- **2. Feedback** makes it clear to the user what action has been taken and what has been accomplished.  Many forms of feedback exist in IxD, including visual, tactile, audio, and more. The key is to design an experience that does not make users guess what action they have to take and what the outcome will be.


## SLIDE 43
- **3. Constraints** are about limiting the range of interaction possibilities for the user to simplify the interface and guide the user to the appropriate next action. Constraints are clarifying since they make it clear what to do. Limitless possibilities often leave the user confused. Foursquare uses design constraints to limit available interactions and focus user’s tasks.
- **4. Mapping** is about having a clear relationship between controls and the effect they have on the world. You want this mapping to feel as natural as possible.
- Stovetops are a great example here. When you see an illustration of a stove top, it may be challenging to understand which knob operates which burner. With better mapping, however, it becomes *much* clearer which knob controls which burner.

## SLIDE 44
- **5. Consistency** refers to having similar operations and similar elements for achieving related tasks. By leveraging consistent features throughout your entire experience, you make your experience far more comfortable to use. Consistency is essential in your interface, and across the many interfaces, users use across their devices.
- **6. Affordance** refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. To afford means to give a clue. The physical button on a mouse provides a hint that it can be clicked to perform an action. When an object has strong affordances, it’s obvious how to use it.

> *"Micro-interactions are events that have one main task—a single purpose—and they’re found all over your device and within apps. Their purpose is to delight the user: to create a moment that is engaging, welcoming and, dare we say it, human."* —Vamsi Batchu, UX designer and writer

Single-task events, or interactions, that have the goal of delighting users. Micro-interaction is what makes a UI system dynamic.

Whenever you change a setting, sync your data or devices, set the alarm, pick a password, log in, set a status message, or favorite or “like” something, you are engaging with a micro-interaction. They are everywhere—in the devices we carry, the appliances in our house, the apps on our phones and desktops, even embedded in the environments we live and work in.

## SLIDE 47
**What are micro-interactions?**  

Micro-interactions are events which have one main task — a single purpose — and they're found all over your device and within apps. Their purpose is to delight the user and to create a moment that is engaging, welcoming, and humane.

**When do designers use micro-interactions?**  

- When a UX/IxD/UI are working on UI features, navigation, and interaction usability.
- During prototyping, testing, and iterations.
- When a UX/UI designer is designing a UI system.  

**Why do we use micro-interactions?** 

- Your user is looking for consistent, clear, logical interactions with features.
- To apply a unique look and feel to your UIs. 
- To meet your user’s needs for recognizable, useful, usable UI elements.


- We’re surrounded by micro-interactions every day, and only designers notice them for what they are. Normal people might think, "Neat!" and move on. Designers know how incredibly important micro-interactions are to UX.

### Micro-interaction Structure 

What makes effective micro-interactions is not only their contained size but also their form. A beautifully crafted micro-interaction pays attention to all four parts of a micro-interaction.

- **Triggers** initiate a micro-interaction.
- **Rules** determine what happens.
- **Feedback** lets people know what’s happening.
- **Loops and modes** determine the meta-rules of the micro-interaction.

> Read the quote by **Dan Saffer**, UX designer and writer: 
>
> *Even though we’re surrounded by micro-interactions every day, we don’t usually notice them until something goes horribly wrong. But micro-interactions are, despite their small size and near-invisibility, incredibly important. The difference between a product you love and a product you tolerate is often the micro-interactions you have with it. They can make our lives easier, more fun, and just more interesting if done well.*

## 8. Instructor Do: Demo - GIPHY Capture (5 min)

> **Instructor Note:** Giphy Capture is only supported by Mac. TAs, share this link for PC users: [https://www.screentogif.com/](https://www.screentogif.com/)

Show the class how to use Giphy to capture a micro-interaction. This knowledge will enable them to capture micro-interactions that they find on apps and sites and keep as visual references.

- Download the Mac app: [https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture).
- Open [https://fluttercore.com/gooey-tab-bar-flutter/](https://fluttercore.com/gooey-tab-bar-flutter/) in your browser.

1. Open Giphy Capture software.

2. Resize the GIF capture area.

3. Record the GIF.

   - Do not exceed 24 seconds per capture.

4. Select a frame rate setting and save the GIF.

   - The longer the time and the more frames, the larger the file size.

5. Add a caption to your GIF video.

   - ![08-Giphy-Capture-Demo.png](Images/08-Giphy-Capture-Demo.png)

6. Save your GIF to your desktop.

   - ![09-Giphy-Capture-Demo.png](Images/09-Giphy-Capture-Demo.png)

- Ask if there are any questions. GIPHY Capture will be super useful for portfolios, as moving images of interfaces—even InVision—are better.

> **Say:** "Now it's your turn to capture a micro-interaction and create a GIF file."

Now that students have seen how it's done, it's time for them to capture and create their own GIF files of the micro-interactions they find on apps and sites.

## 9. Student Do: Capture IxD Activity (10 min)

**TAs:** Slack out the following activity file:

[10-Week/02-Activities/10.1/10.1-02-Capture-Interaction-Design-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-q5hYD66Q7wVM-E8-BxQfj-RKHPovziDpI-Hsfe5UTA)

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor the students for progress and offer support.

**Summary**

This activity allows students to identify mental models and UI interactions in the wild via the web and apps and capture them as GIFs.

*Tips for students who struggle*: With TAs, help them get the GIF capture software downloaded and help them identify an interaction moment worth capturing.

*For students who finish early*: Shouldn't be a problem, but have them keep gathering more samples. A robust set of interaction examples as inspiration is useful far beyond this boot camp.

**Instructions**

Working independently, each student will search webpages of their choice, hunting for examples of a delightful interaction or a recognizable mental model. Once they find one, they will capture the example with a screen recorder. Instructions for downloading the screen recorders are in the activity instructions doc.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. If students need more time, shorten the review.

**Deliverable**

Students will share their GIFs in Slack.


## SLIDE 61
## 10. Instructor Do: Capture IxD Activity Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention and review the GIFs.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** End breakout rooms and call everyone back into the main Zoom room.

Aim to review the work of four to five students.

- Engage discussion by first scrolling through all the GIFs in the Slack channel.

- > **Ask:**
  - "Anyone spotting any patterns in these GIFs?"
    - For example, are there a lot of flashing button GIFs?
  - "Anyone see a GIF they'd call 'delightful'?"
    - Discuss what makes it "delightful."
  - "How important are the steps in making it delightful?"
- **Invite students to critique the GIFs.**
  - Call on students to critique the delightful moments:
    - What's working?
    - What could be changed?

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a personal story of making delightful moments in UI. Alternatively, invite a TA to share.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about capturing IxD. For example:
  - "Video is the superior way to capture an experience" *False.* Some of the most delightful interface moments are very short and can be captured through GIFs. Make sure they are short, as your GIF can get too big.
  - "Capturing motion is about gathering what works." *True.* Like fish are drawn to shiny objects, we too need to understand what types of motion draw users in and what they are more likely to ignore. Recommend starting small with motion before getting crazy.

With this activity, your students have been able to integrate the fundamentals of IxD principles, micro-interactions, and mental models. This wraps up the second part of today's lesson.

Students now have three of today's learning objectives under their belt: the ability to identify examples of IxD, the five IxD dimensions, and micro-interactions on sites and apps in the wild.

### Habits and Habit Loops

Habits impact our daily lives in many different ways, even in how we interact with websites and applications. Being aware of how habits may influence interactions users have with your products can help you design a better UX.

The habit loop is a neurological loop that governs any habit. Understanding the elements of habits can help in understanding how to change bad habits or form better ones.

**What is a habit loop?**

The habit loop is a neurological loop that governs any habit.  The habit loop consists of three elements: a cue, a routine, and a reward. Understanding these elements can help in understanding how to change bad habits or form better ones.

**When do designers use habit loops?**

- When a UX/IxD/UI are working on UI features, navigation, and interaction usability.
- During prototyping, testing, and iterations.
- When a UX/UI designer is designing a UI system. 

**Why do we use habit loops?**

- Your user is looking for consistent, clear, logical interactions with features as well as reason to continue using your UI.
- To make your solutions “sticky” and useful to your users. 
- To meet your user’s needs for recognizable, useful, usable UI elements.

## SLIDE 65
In *The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business*, Charles Duhigg explains the process of habit creation. At the core of every habit is a simple neurological loop that is composed of three parts:

- **Cue**: A cue is “a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use.” Triggers can include places, times of day, emotions, and more.

- **Routine**: In response to the cue, you act. It can be a physical action like drinking coffee or a cerebral one like Googling a question.

- **Reward**: This is the benefit you get from completing the routine. It’s the part that tells your brain that the action is worth repeating over again. The reward can be anything: a feeling of joy, a boost of energy, or a question answered.

- **TAs:** Slack out in the #resources this book recommendation on Slack: [https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_3?crid=XXF54G9ZF5H3&keywords=power+of+habit&qid=1558033655&s=gateway&sprefix=power+of+habit%2Caps%2C196&sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_3?crid=XXF54G9ZF5H3&keywords=power+of+habit&qid=1558033655&s=gateway&sprefix=power+of+habit%2Caps%2C196&sr=8-3) for students to add to their UX libraries for later reading.

## SLIDE 66
### Hook Habit Model

After researching habits and behavior changes, Nir Eyal analyzed many huge companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Instagram. Based on this work, he developed the **hook model theory** to describe habits. In a nutshell, the theory states that the holy grail for digital product makers is for their offering to become part of a customer’s habitual behavior. The hook model relies on a trigger, action, reward, and investment.

- **A trigger,** or, as Charles Duhigg calls it, a cue, causes an individual to take action. Triggers can be internal or external. Intense emotions like loneliness, boredom, stress, and uncertainty are internal triggers. Ads, friend recommendations, messages, and weather are external triggers.

- **An action,** or routine, is what the trigger causes a person to do afterward. Actions on the web can be scrolling, refreshing, tapping, playing, listening, liking, and so on.

- **A reward** is simply something a person is craving. A reward can take the form of recognition, acceptance, joy, competition, material, or information rewards.

- **An investment** is what users are prepared to do to get more rewards. Nir Eyal introduced this habit loop addition after seeing how repeated rewards add up, like LinkedIn connections, that make you easily invest more time in using the platform. Investments are for future benefits, such as money, personal data, effort, time, and social capital.

- **TAs:** Slack out in the #resources channel this book recommendation [https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hooked+nir&qid=1558033684&s=gateway&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hooked+nir&qid=1558033684&s=gateway&sr=8-1) for students to add to their UX libraries for later reading.

## SLIDE 67

Review why changing user habits is essential:

- Habits increase customer lifetime value.
- Habits provide greater pricing flexibility.
- Habits supercharge growth. “Hooked” users don’t churn.
- Habits improve a business’s defensibility. It’s hard to get someone to stop using a product that they use without thinking.

## 13. Instructor Do: Demo - Micro-interaction Adobe XD (10 min)

**Instructions**
Walk through the Adobe XD sample in prototype mode to show off each micro-interaction.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Don't stop sharing your screen. Be vocal about where you are pointing on screen during each action.

> **Instructor Note:** Use Adobe XD to demonstrate micro-animation features specific to this prototyping tool sample.

**Review** the following video as a support reference for this demo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II_iz5gN3lY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II_iz5gN3lY).

1. Download the sample Adobe XD file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f09ZrQP3Jr-dlSlwjfncRNeMBlbJmaO5/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f09ZrQP3Jr-dlSlwjfncRNeMBlbJmaO5/view?usp=sharing)

   - You will be working on this file in class.

   - Students should be encouraged to download the file and follow along.

2. Example 1: Add animation to a heart icon.

   - > **Say:** Imagine we wanted to create a micro-interaction when we tapped a Like button. How might we do that?

   - Select the heart icon on the screen: LIKE-1.

   - In prototype mode, click and drag to the heart icon on the screen: LIKE-2.

   - Set the Trigger to Tap, the Action to Auto Animate, the destination to Like-2, the easing to Wind Up, and the Duration to 0.3s.

   - ![Heart Animation](Images/XD-01.png)

   - In prototype mode, select the artboard LIKE-2 and drag to the artboard LIKE-3.

   - Set the Trigger to Time, the Duration to 0, the action to auto-animate, the easing to easing-out, and the duration to 0.2s.

   - ![Heart Animation](Images/XD-02.png)

   - **Press play** and demo the interaction.

3. Example 2: Add parallax scrolling to a website.

   - > **Say:** Parallax design has become a prevalent interaction on the web. Let's walk through how we might create an interaction between two different screen states for a landing page.

   - Zoom out on your artboard and zoom in on the desktop screens. Select the DESKTOP-10 artboard and click and drag it to the DESKTOP-11 artboard.

   - In the animation window, set the trigger to time, a delay of 0.4s, action to auto-animate, the destination to desktop-11, easing to easing-out, and duration to 2s.

   - Feel free to play around with duration. If you make the length too short, the interaction will feel rushed.

   - ![Parallax](Images/XD-03.png)

   - **Press play** and demo the interaction.

4. Example 3: Make a swipeable card UI.

   - > **Say:** Let's look at an example of a dragging interaction.

   - It's important to note that as long as the layers are grouped with at least one object in the active bounds, they will remain part of the same artboard. Otherwise, they will shift over to the paste artboard.

   - Let's click into the object we want to make swipeable. We will select that object, click the blue arrow in prototype mode, and drag it to our next screen.

   - ![Parallax](Images/XD-04.png)

   - In the interaction window, set the trigger to drag and the action to auto-animate.

   - ![Parallax](Images/XD-05.png)

   - Let's look at what happens.

   - **Press play** and demo the interaction.

- Now let's add a tap-trigger so we can select an object.

  - Double-click into the second screen and select the main object. Click and drag to the third artboard.

  - Under trigger select tap, for action select auto-animate, for a destination select the artboard. To make things easier, select snap and set a duration to 0.4s.

  - ![Parallax](Images/XD-06.png)

## SLIDES 78-79
## 14. Student Do: Micro-interaction Prototype Activity (30 min)

In this activity, you will work individually to build and prototype a micro-interaction in Figma/Adobe XD.

**TAs:** Slack out to students in the #_in_class_chat channel the following activity files:

- [10-Week/02-Activities/10.1/10.1-03-Micro-Interaction-Prototype-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vLxJlSkDnsSv3gpBANpgZSMUOrSh9mXndkfZcDoLnbw)

- [Boot Camp Figma Team 10.1-03-Micro-Interaction-Samples-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/9wqClddq5lXaGpzmgkODXK/10.1-03-UI-Micro-Interaction-Samples-Template?node-id=0%3A1)

**Instructor and TAs:** During this activity, monitor the students for progress and offer support. Help out if they are missing everyday web tasks, such as buying products, registering, creating a profile, searching, saving, rating, watching, etc.

**Summary**

Here students will work in Figma/Adobe XD to design a micro-interaction prototype.

**Instructions**

First thing, have students open the Figma/Adobe XD materials in the Activity folder and download the samples they want to work with. From there, each student will design a micro-interaction in Figma/Adobe XD and animate it. Finally, students will share their work with a classmate for a feedback session. Following that, they may choose to iterate their micro-interaction.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them all share their screens. During review, take volunteers to highlight their screen.

**Deliverable**

Students will share a prototype of an animated micro-interaction on Slack in the #_in_class_chat channel.

## 15. Instructor Do: Micro-interaction Prototype Activity Review (15 min)

- Call the class back to attention and lead a review of micro-interaction Figma/Adobe XD prototypes.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** End breakout rooms and call everyone back into the main Zoom room.

- Aim to review the work of three to four students.
- Ask students to present their work at the front of the classroom.
- Facilitate peer feedback and give your own.

- **Discussion facilitation questions to consider:**
  - Why did you choose this micro-interaction?
  - Why do you believe this micro-interaction is improving your user's experience?
  - Have you seen a micro-interaction like this before or did you start from scratch?

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they apply micro-interactions to prototypes, for example:

  - Micro-interactions should not be too obnoxious or jarring—if a student's animation moves too fast or calls attention to itself in a distracting way, help nuance the prototype.

  - Micro-interactions should occur where the user expects them. For example, an upload button turning into and animating the upload process. If a student is triggering an animation in their prototype that is not connected to an interaction, reinforce the role of micro-interactions as a way to improve and focus your user, not to distract them or get them to pay attention to other parts of the interface.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about micro-interactions. For example:

  - "Your user doesn't remember a micro-interaction." *False.* The micro interaction can be the most memorable feature. Remember the pull down to refresh your emails in iOS?

  - "Micro-interactions are too time consuming for development." *False.* A UX/UI designer should be pushing at the limits and trying to build the best experience at all times.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Invite a TA to share a professional anecdote about micro-interactions.

- **TAs:** Slack out in the #_in_class_chat channel the solution file for students:
  - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MCIvZO-wQ2qRLbGYK37hFunns0w5j-KW/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MCIvZO-wQ2qRLbGYK37hFunns0w5j-KW/view?usp=sharing)

## 16. Instructor Do: Recap (2 min)

- This brings class to a close.
  - To close, do a quick recap of the concepts learned today.
  - Then spend five minutes explaining Challenge 10 to the class.

- You did it!

**Review concepts.**

Spend a couple of minutes helping students anchor today’s learning. Ask students to raise their hands—or post answers in Slack—and offer definitions for the following concepts, all learned today in class:

1. Ask a few students to provide descriptions of IxD. (Answers may include: An interaction designer is the person on the design team who helps form and create a design strategy, identifies critical interactions of the product, creates prototypes to test concepts, and stays current on technology and trends that will impact users.)
2. Ask why "delighting" a user matters. (Answers may include: That is our job, or businesses want to delight their customers, or to build brand loyalty.)
3. What is an example of a mental model (i.e., a way that you expect something to go)? (Answers may include: A book opens and has pages.)
4. Recall as many of the six IxD Principles as you can. (If students can't recall all six, review: visibility, feedback, constraints, mapping, consistency, and affordance.)
5. Ask who can define habit loops and recall various parts of the habit loop cycle. (Answers may include: Cue > Routine > Reward or A trigger > An action > A reward > An investment).

Once you've addressed questions, move on to the challenge.

## 17. Instructor Do: Challenge 10 and End Class (5 min)

Students now have some of the skills they need to execute the challenge. Remind them that they will continue learning more about what they need throughout the week. *Don't wait—start working on the challenge now.*

- **Challenge 10 document:** Ask TAs to slack out this week's challenge in the #_in_class_chat channel: [10-Week/04-Homework/01-Instructions/Unit-10-Homework-Google-Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CmZ00obugCnRVJHsW27yjhOwF3IjZduSYXtHqGfGrk4).

  - > **Say:** The skills you just learned are fresh and need to be nurtured to stick. Challenge is about practice. Only practice will improve your skills.
- **Reminder:** Everyone should be adding to their InVision prototypes and making progress on their challenge.

- **Office hours:** Remind students that you are holding office hours after class.

Take questions and wish everyone a good night.
