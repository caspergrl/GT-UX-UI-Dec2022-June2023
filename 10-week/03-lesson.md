# 10.3 Lesson Plan: UI Components and Multistate Elements

---

## Overview

In today's class, students will build their UI skills by learning the value of buttons and designing a mobile UI form prototype to be tested by their classmates.

In lessons 10.1 and 10.2, students gained skills in interaction design and atomic design principles. They practiced building scalable UI components, build buttons, and clickable prototypes.

All together, Unit 10 enables students to deepen their high-fidelity web prototyping skills, leverage their new knowledge of responsive design, and test their solutions for further iterations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

1. Explain the value of a useful UI button, and define the five interaction states (normal, focused, hover, active, and disabled).

2. Design and build UI buttons for all five button states in Figma/Adobe XD.

3. Design and build a mobile UI form prototype in Figma/Adobe XD.

## Class at a Glance

Welcome to Lesson 10.3 on UI components and multistate elements. The lesson has three parts:
- Part 1 will introduce multistate UI buttons.
    - *Class will include a demo of how to build multistate UI buttons with Adobe XD or Figma.*
- Part 2 will cover best practices with mobile UI forms.
- Part 3 will teach designing and testing a mobile UI form prototype.
    - *Class includes a demo of creating a mobile UI form prototype using Adobe XD or Figma.*

By the end of today's class, students will gain confidence in building the interactions associated with an interface, including buttons and forms.

## Instructor Notes

Remember, you can lose the class‚Äôs focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

üåê **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students‚Äô feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.‚Äù
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: ‚ÄúBear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.‚Äù


## Prepare for Class

Review your slides: [10-Week/01-Slides/10.3-UX-UI-Components-Plus-Library Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15sOkQ_jps2dayLG_x-ZxT1XgMehdbolzwo5wZooYig0).
- Today's lesson contains two demos, so practice a run-through on your own before class:
  - Multistate UI button (Section 4)
  - Mobile UI Forms (Section 12).
- Before class, share your favorite UI resources with students on Slack.
- Most students strive to do polished, professional work, so find ways to reassure them of the value of creating lower fidelity work to practice what they've learned.
- Encourage students to practice often outside of class‚Äîon their own or with classmates.
- Remember that your energy, as well as that of the teaching assistants (TAs), sets the tone for the class. If you're enthusiastic, students will be, too.

## Office Hours: Reviews and Practice (45 min before class)

Encourage your students to use office hours. By the same token, encourage them to make the most out of class by asking questions, which has benefits for their classmates.

---

## 1. Instructor: Welcome and Share Today's Objectives (3 min)

- Open up the slides for the lecture: [10-Week/01-Slides/10.3-UX-UI-Components-Plus-Library Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15sOkQ_jps2dayLG_x-ZxT1XgMehdbolzwo5wZooYig0)

  - **TAs:** Make a PDF copy and share in Google Drive for class and share slides via Slack.

  - Tell students that UI design will continue to get harder; urge them to dedicate as much time as possible to practice at home.
- Connect today's lesson to the foundation students built during their weeks studying UX:
  - UX is about understanding your user deeply to solve their problems. Today we will apply UX user needs into granular UI elements via interactive high-fidelity prototypes.
  - UX considers user interactions with a system through iterate > prototype > test through a low fidelity. Today we will improve our high-fidelity design skills by producing UI elements that have all the look and feel of the real thing.

**Review today's objectives.**

Next, you'll briefly review atomic design to refresh students' memories and help them internalize it as an approach to UI elements, such as buttons and forms.

## 2. Instructor Do: Review Atomic Design (3 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to refresh students' memories of atomic design and connect it to hermeneutics, the study of interpretation.

Engage students in an important, yet brief, review of Atomic Design.

**Ask:** "Can anyone tell me where you start with atomic design?"
  - Answers might include:
    - Start with atoms.
    - Start with organisms.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students utilize the "raise hand" feature in Zoom. Call on a student, have them come off mute, and let them answer.

- Follow up with "Why?"
  - *Answer:* UI can be started in many ways, but thinking about outlining the user goals of the interface and then applying the atoms through to the pages is an effective strategy. Small to big, but big must go back to small. A button can be designed out of context of a page but will be impacted by how it is used on a larger page.

### Refresher on Atomic Design

It's a system that helps designers understand the relationship between design elements and the systems they comprise.

- **For example,** to understand a book, we must understand the words and sentences contained within it. However, their context informs the meanings of those words and sentences. One informs the other. This is called a **hermeneutic cycle** [hur¬∑muh¬∑noo¬∑tuhk].

### The Design Thinking Process Is a Hermeneutic Cycle

- The parts (atoms, molecules, and organisms) of the UI system build the whole (templates and pages). The desired functionality of the templates and pages inform which atoms, molecules, and organisms to employ in the UI design.

  - A button cannot be designed out of context to how it will be used‚Äîotherwise, the button's design is faulty. Remember: form follows function.

- **TAs:** Slack out into the #resource channel [https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/hermeneutics-for-designers/](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/hermeneutics-for-designers/) for students to review at home.

Keep the atomic design thread going, and discuss how it relates to button design in the next lecture.

## 3. Instructor Do: Multistate Elements and UI Button Design (15 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to connect atomic design ideas to specific UI elements, buttons in this case that will support the first and second learning objectives for today. Students will be able to articulate the five interaction states for buttons and design and test UI buttons for those states.

The following lecture will help you connect atomic design thinking (from last class) to button design. Remind students that atomic design approaches a website as a dynamic grouping of components, a system that builds a whole.

> **Say:** "The atomic design ideas we learned last class apply to buttons. How? Buttons are dynamic and composed of various parts. A button is an atomic UI molecule!"

### Define the Purpose of Buttons

Buttons are nothing more than opportunities for your users to interact, whether that be a link, feature, or content review. Buttons are designed to grab a user's attention. Positive user experiences depend on buttons being well-designed.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Ask one or two students to explain how buttons are "dynamic" and composed of parts. (This will teach them about buttons while reinforcing earlier learning about atomic design principles.)
>
> - Answers may include: In the real world, a button can be pushed and is on or off.

### UI Elements and States

- States communicate the status of UI elements to the user.
  - A **button state** refers to the state in which a button exists, which is driven by the user's actions.
  - For example, when a user clicks on a button on a site, that button changes states‚Äîfrom "unclicked" to "clicked." You've seen this with URLs, which change color once you click them. In this way, "states" communicate user actions in relation to a button.

Each button state should:

- Be visually similar.
- Not drastically alter a component.
- Have clear affordances that distinguish it from other states and the surrounding layout.

### UI Buttons Tool Snapshot

**What are UI buttons?**

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like dialogs, forms, toolbars, etc.

**When do designers use UI buttons?**

- Buttons are used when you are performing an action, such as ‚Äúsubmit,‚Äù ‚Äúmerge,‚Äù ‚Äúcreate new,‚Äù ‚Äúupload,‚Äù etc.

- During prototyping, testing, and iterations.

- When a UX/UI designer is designing a UI system. 

**Why do we use UI buttons?**

- Your user is looking for consistent, clear, logical interactions with buttons.
- To apply sound affordance to your UIs. 

- To meet your user‚Äôs needs for recognizable, useful, usable UI elements.

### Walk Through Types of UI States

- **Enabled:** An enabled state communicates an interactive component or element.
- **Disabled:** A disabled state communicates a non-interactive component or element.
- **Hover:** A hover state communicates when a user has placed a cursor above an interactive element (e.g., something the user can click on to go deeper into the app or webpage).
- **Focused:** A focused state communicates when a user has highlighted an element, using an input method such as a keyboard or voice.
- **Selected:** A selected state communicates a user's choice.
- **Activated:** An activated state communicates a highlighted destination, whether initiated by the user or by default.
- **Pressed:** A pressed state communicates a user tap.
- **Dragged:** A dragged state communicates when a user presses and moves an element.
- **On:** An on state communicates a toggle between two options.
- **Off:** An off state communicates a toggle between two options.
- **Error:** An error state communicates a user or system mistake.

### UI Buttons

- Buttons are a seemingly ordinary, workaday element of interaction design. However, because users encounter them so often, they are a vital element in creating a smooth user interaction experience on the web and in apps.

- It's worth paying particular attention to their design. We'll go over button types and states and discuss best practices for button design so that you can create useful buttons that improve the UX.

### Walk Through UI Button States

- A button isn‚Äôt a one-state object. It‚Äôs a multistate object. The button changes when a user‚Äôs mouse hovers over it changes color when clicked, produces text, displays text such as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre enrolled!‚Äù and so forth.

- Designers are responsible for the visual feedback users receive when they interact with an app or site.

- UI buttons are meant to direct users to take the action that you want them to take (e.g., sign up, enroll, find out more, etc.). Glitches‚Äîsuch as the inability to find the correct button‚Äîare, at best, interruptions and can become, at worst, breakdowns.

1. **Normal state:** The main rule for this state: a UI button should look like a button in a normal state. Windows 8 is an excellent example of such a problem; it is hard for users to know if things are clickable or not in Settings.

2. **Focused state:** Offer good visual feedback to users. A focused state communicates when a user has highlighted an element.

3. **Hover state:** Offering good visual feedback to users that they‚Äôre hovering over a button is good practice. Users instantly know their action was accepted, and they want to be delighted by visual rewards.

4. **Active/pressed state:** By animating different elements of your design, you can add a bit of excitement and delight your users with creative and helpful motion.

5. **Disabled/inactive state:** There are two possibilities‚Äîeither show it in a disabled state or hide the UI button.
   - Hiding UI buttons is not recommended for usability and accessibility issues.

### Arguments for Hiding the Button

- **Clarity:** It only shows what is needed for the task at hand.

  - Gmail hides unused buttons and makes them visible only if the user takes an appropriate action.

Arguments for using a disabled state:

- Shows the action possibility. Even if the button isn‚Äôt in use, the user can learn that the action is possible.
  
- You may even have a tooltip explaining the criteria for use.
  
- Control location. The user can learn where controls and buttons live within the interface.

- > **Ask:** Which button state is on desktop only?
- Answer: The desktop has a hover state as the dominant interaction model for desktop computers in the mouse and keyboard.

- **TAs:** Slack out the following links into the #resources channel for students to read at home.:
  - [https://uxplanet.org/7-rules-for-mobile-ui-button-design-e9cf2ea54556](https://uxplanet.org/7-rules-for-mobile-ui-button-design-e9cf2ea54556)
  - [https://uxplanet.org/7-basic-rules-for-button-design-63dcdf5676b4](https://uxplanet.org/7-basic-rules-for-button-design-63dcdf5676b4)

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Now, share how you approach button states in your client work.

### Review UI Button Design Best Practices

- **Test all of your buttons.** Testing will validate if your button is achieving its design and interface potential.

- **Make buttons look like buttons.** When it comes to interacting with a UI, users need to know instantly what's clickable and what‚Äôs not. Every item in a design requires effort by the user to decode. Generally, the more time needed for users to decode the UI, the less usable it becomes for them.

- **Label buttons with what they do.** Buttons with generic or misleading labels can be a massive source of frustration for your users. Write button labels that clearly explain what each button does. Ideally, the button‚Äôs label should clearly describe its action.

- **Make buttons finger-friendly for mobile users.** In many mobile apps, buttons are too small, which often leads to a situation in which users mistype.

- **Use button shapes.** Make buttons square or square with rounded corners, depending on the style of the site or app.

- **Provide visual or audio feedback on interaction.** When users click or tap on the button, they expect that the UI will respond with appropriate feedback. For example, use a ‚Äúding‚Äù or ‚Äúswoosh‚Äù sound or a visual indicator like color, text, or a checkmark that confirms the user transaction was successful.

- **Put buttons where users expect to find them.** Buttons should be located in places where users can easily find them or expect to see them. Don‚Äôt make users hunt for buttons. If users can‚Äôt find a button, they won‚Äôt know that it exists.

- **Mind the order.** The order for buttons should reflect the nature of a conversation between the user and the system. Ask yourself, in what order do users expect buttons to appear on this screen? Design accordingly.

- **Avoid using too many buttons.** This is a common problem for many apps and websites. When you provide too many options, your users end up doing nothing. When designing pages in your app or website, think about the most important actions you want your users to take.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX/UI designer, you are expected to be experts in buttons and maintaining a user interface system. This includes being skilled at executing the correct button interactions and "sweating all the little details." UI button design should be added to your resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

> **Instructor Note:** Let's take a moment to check in with the class and see how comfortable they're feeling with the topic we just covered. Stop sharing your screen for a moment and switch to Gallery View in Zoom to see your class on one screen. You can find this option in the top right.

> Ask your class to rate their level of understanding by raising their hand for a "Fist-to-Five" check. A closed fist (0) means they are lost on the topic and need much more help. An open hand (5) means they completely understand everything that was covered and feel confident and ready to go.

> Use the feedback from this check to recommend office hours to review things more in depth, or adjust your pace throughout the rest of the class

Seeing is believing. Follow up your discussion of buttons and button states with a demo. Show students how designers build buttons in Adobe XD to prepare them to create their own.

## 4. Instructor Do: Demo - Multistate UI Button (15 min)

You will demo how to build a multistate button in Figma/Adobe XD.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Share your screen and be vocal about what action you are taking on the screen. We recommend increasing your cursor size through your computer system accessibility features.

If you need additional resources on how to build a button in Adobe XD, please watch this link:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfrdX3tAbkk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfrdX3tAbkk)

**Instructions**

1. Download the multistate button starter template:

    - For XD: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WQHJ7y0lSYWcvUSsgdL3N4Q5gxKGHFTa](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WQHJ7y0lSYWcvUSsgdL3N4Q5gxKGHFTa)

2. Start by creating animation for artboards 1-3.

   ![Button demo](Images/00.png)

3. Select the button on artboard 1 and drag it to the next screen to create an interaction. Set the trigger to tap, the action to auto-animate, the destination to board 2, easing to ease out, and the duration to 0.4s.

   ![Button demo](Images/01.png)

4. Select the entire artboard 2 and drag it to the next screen to create an interaction. Set the trigger to time, the duration to 0.8s, and the action to auto-animate.

   ![Button demo](Images/03.png)

5. **Select artboard 1, and then press play and demo the button.**

   ![Button demo](Images/a.png)

6. Start by creating three buttons on artboards 4, 5, and 6. Create a button with a normal state, hover state, and active state. Copy and paste the rectangle from artboard 4 to artboard 5. Add a drop shadow. Copy and paste the rectangle from artboard 5 to artboard 6. Change the color of the shape to a darker tint.

   ![Button demo](Images/04.png)

7. Add a link from artboard 4 to artboard 5. Set the trigger to time, delay to 0.6s, the action to transition, and the animation to dissolve.

   ![Button demo](Images/05.png)

8. Add a link from artboard 5 to artboard 6. Set the trigger to time, delay to 0.6s, the action to transition, and the animation to dissolve.

   ![Button demo](Images/06.png)

9. Select artboard 4, press play, and demo the interaction.

10. **Demo and slack out** the multistate button solution file: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EmG7J5BC82O3-QuTgDuQRwRxgpDxS-ZP](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EmG7J5BC82O3-QuTgDuQRwRxgpDxS-ZP)

Now that students have a grasp on how designers use Adobe XD to build multistate buttons, let them try creating buttons of their own. That's up next.

## 5. Student Do: Multistate UI Buttons Activity (20 min)

For the next activity, students will design buttons with their partners. Remind your students of the roles and responsibilities of the driver and navigator, emphasizing that both are important as you will create multistate buttons as a team.

**TAs:** Slack students the following Google Doc activity:

- [10-Week/02-Activities/10.3/10.3-01-Multi-State-Design-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W7_Lf63808CX3ufNuz0pzerauYxOsgJB0ffr5b28SB8)

- [10.3-03-Figma Template UI Button Samples](https://www.figma.com/file/YAeAqGYRt1Gb8G5wpjC9qR/10.3-01-UI-Button-Samples-Template?node-id=0%3A1)

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor students and offer to help those struggling to assemble multistate buttons.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Get students into Zoom breakout rooms of two to three people, with TAs assigned to assist. TAs can reference the agency selection template to establish these student groupings. If students need more time, you can reduce the review time.

**Summary**

In this activity, you will work with your classmates to design multistate buttons.

*Tips for students who struggle*: Encourage students to start on default buttons styles first. A rectangle or a pill. Work with students to start on a piece of paper thinking through the decisions before jumping into design software. Most software is for executing, not ideation.

*For students who finish early*: There are thousands of ways to execute buttons. Have them design another version.

**Instructions**

Working in pairs, students will complete the three-part activity:

1. Sketch five sets of buttons (10 min).
2. Build their partner's buttons in Figma/Adobe XD (8 min).
3. Share buttons in Slack (2 min).

**Deliverable**

Students will create each other's buttons based on sketches.

## 6. Instructor Do: Multistate UI Buttons Activity Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention and lead a review of the button sketches and Figma/Adobe XD button designs.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Invite students back to the main Zoom room and have them share their work in gallery view to review and discuss their work.

- Review the work of two to four students, or whatever time allows.
- Begin by asking a student to share their work.
- Possible discussion prompts:

**Ask:**
- Why is a button necessary for a website?
    - *Answer:* It signals to a user through affordance and encourages a behavior (such as moving to the checkout stage of a purchase).
- Does anyone have a favorite button?
    - *Answer:* Share your favorite button (e.g., Google's "I'm feeling lucky" button).
- What is the button color of Target?
    - *Answer:* Red.

Discuss how changing a button is not as easy as it seems because you have trained your audience with the UI, and change is something they do not like!

Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work the next time they design buttons. For example:

  - Use align to center your typography is centered in button instance.
  - Do not use display typefaces in buttons.

Let students know that if they want more feedback on their UI buttons, they should stay for office hours.

Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about buttons. For example:

  - "Developers will just use a prebuilt button design." *False.* If you don't supply a good button design, then yes, that could happen, but your role as a UI designer is to care about the details. Love your buttons!

  - "Users don't really care how the button is designed." *False.* A good button can be the difference between a usable and unusable system‚Äîyour users should, of course, test buttons. Remember, always be testing and iterating (ABTI).

It's time to set buttons aside for a moment and use the ideas learned to approach another UI element: the form. Buttons and forms are both critical UI elements for customer enjoyment and retention. Designers spend a lot of time iterating on button designs to get them right.

## 7. Instructor Do: UI Form Best Practices (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to help students understand the best practices designers use to create forms. This will give them something to measure their own forms against. This lecture, and the activities that follow, support the third, and final, learning objective for today, which is to build a UI form prototype.

You're moving onto forms, but they are not that different from buttons. Both are dynamic UI elements. Both are business-critical‚Äîcompanies whose users have bad button or form experiences have trouble retaining customers.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students utilize the "raise hand" feature in Zoom. Call on a student, have them come off mute, and let them answer.

- > **Ask:**  "What's a form?"
  >
  > - Correct answers include: A place for users to type in information, a place to search a site, a part of e-commerce, or a way to supply payment information.

The harder a form is to use, the less likely it is that your client will convert. When visitors to a site or app struggle with a form, they blame the business.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As UX/UI designers, you will work on UI forms, guaranteed. Therefore, you should be experts and have samples of these deliverables in your portfolios. Show employers that you know how to create a good user experience on UI forms, and you will be trusted to do the same for user features‚Äîi.e., fun and exciting work. Add UI form best practices to your resume skills and LinkedIn skills profile.

### Review Web Form UX/UI
Web form UX is the process of focusing on how your site visitors interact with every aspect of your form. Successful web form UX ensures your form is easy to use, accessible, convenient, and professional. In turn, it helps you boost conversions and drive more business.

### Why Do UI Forms Matter?

The point of a web form is to collect certain personal information from your visitor, whether that be an email address or shipping and payment details. Why would visitors want to convert and conduct any business with you if the form they‚Äôre being asked to list their information on is difficult to use or visually unattractive? Simple answer, they wouldn‚Äôt.

- Several factors go into great UX. Form UX matters because you want to leave a good (and lasting) impression on your visitors, create a positive experience for them while on your site, and convert more leads.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Describe how your approach to making web forms is powerful for your clients and their site users.
>
> - Alternatively, invite a TA to share a web form design anecdote from their own professional experience.

### UI Forms Tool Snapshot

**What are UI forms?**

A form is a UI element that allows the user to send information to a server. 

**When do designers use UI forms?**

- Designing and developing a responsive web design system and building feature that require users to exchange data.

- Making decisions about user interaction, databases, and user communications.

- Great for exploring functionality and usability before dedicating time and resources to visual design.

**Why do we use UI forms?**

- UI forms can be hard to design. UI forms as prototypes can add clarity to complexity. 

- Can help build cohesion and consistency to a digital product‚Äôs UI and experience.

- UI forms help communicate what information is being stored with back-end developers. 

### **Review the UI form best practice examples.**

Forms are an essential part of many UIs.

- What aspects of UX require a form?
  - Surveys
  - Login
  - Email list
  - Profile
  - Application
- Buttons are essential in UI forms.
- UI forms are a crucial aspect of many webpages and businesses.
- The nine web form design best practices:
  1. Be simple, straightforward.
  2. Use one column.
  3. Arrange your form fields from easiest to hardest.
  4. Use inline form field validation.
  5. Align text to the left.
  6. Use autofill browsers.
  7. Address possible user concerns with summary boxes.
  8. Include smart defaults.
  9. Add progress bars for long forms.
- Now it is your turn to practice building a mobile UI form.

Give students a chance to apply the best practices for form design themselves in the next activity.

## 8. Student Do: Mobile UI Form Paper Prototype Activity (15 min)

**TAs:** Slack out to students the following file in the #_in_class_chat channel:
[10-Week/02-Activities/10.3/10.3-02-UI-Form-Paper-Prototype-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wMW5ch370Cjb8BoQKg-UW45ClH38VgxAhOlswb8bzxE)

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor students and offer to help with their forms.

- Set a timer and help teams make progress.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** During production, students should work independently. Encourage students to use paper and pencil, but it's OK if they use Figma. Have all students share their screens and keep Zoom in gallery view. Remind students that questions on Slack are welcome and will be monitored. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

Before everyone goes into their activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack are welcome and will be monitored. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through students.

**Summary**

Here, students will gain practice sketching user forms.

*Tips for students who struggle*: With TAs, work with students who don't jump right in. Sketching ideas is hard, so have them start by outlining all the atoms for their interface before drawing any wireframe.

*For students who finish early*: Shouldn't be a problem, but have them start pulling their UI form sketches into Figma/Adobe XD Slack.

**Instructions**

Students will sketch UI forms that contain required and non-required fields on paper for a mobile screen state.

**Part 1: Sketch a multistate form (14 min).**

Students will sketch their UI form, which must contain fields for email, password, confirm password, birthday, and gender. Next, they will design screens to display error messages and success messages.

- When half the allotted time for the activity has passed, unmute and let students know. Alternatively, feel free to screen share a countdown timer. One is available on Google by searching timer.

**Part 2: Share your sketches in Slack (1 min).**

Take photos of your sketches and share them in Slack.

As a bonus, students can trade sketches and review with a classmate.

- Students will need to take pictures of their sketches to share.
- If students need more time, reduce the review time.

**Deliverable**

Students will create a multistate UI form.

## 9. Instructor Do: Mobile UI Form Paper Prototype Activity Review (10 min)

- Call attention back and lead a review of students' form prototypes.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have students share their sketches through Slack, or they can hold it up to their camera to save time.

Review six or more students' forms, if possible.
- First, slowly scroll through the samples in Slack. Direct the class to notice how each student designed their error and success messages.
- Then, select the first mobile UI form to critique.

**Ask the following:**
- Why have you asked these sequences of questions?
- Why have you used this typeface for the form?
- How long do you think it would take a user to complete this UI form?

Has the student used UI form best practices? Point out if they need to adhere to better form standards.

Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their sketches the next time. For example:
- UI forms can be prototyped quickly so that they can be tested with users. Follow best practices and care about your forms.

Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about the UI forms. For example:
- "Users don't want to use UI forms." *False.* UI forms are used billions of times daily for ecommerce for marketing etc. Do it right, and you can improve ROI.
- "UI forms are easy to develop" *False.* If you have UX/UI designers who hold development teams to a high-quality bar, then yes, but terrible forms continue to exist. Don't be a UX/UI designer who thinks you are above designing a form.

üíé **Designer Insight:** Wrap up the review by sharing a personal experience with forms‚Äîor invite a TA to share an anecdote about forms in his or her design work.

## 10. Break (15 min)

Let's take a break.

Let students know that when they return from break, you'll dive even deeper into forms.

**Optional:** If there's good energy and you're tight on time, feel free to shorten the break.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Don't stop sharing your screen. Instead, put up a Google or YouTube timer video. A visual time will help get students back into the main Zoom room on time.

## 11. Instructor Do: Mobile UI Forms Dos and Don'ts (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to drive home what to do and what *not* to do with UI forms. This lecture also supports the third, and final, learning objective to build a UI form prototype in Figma/Adobe XD.

In this section, you're going to go a bit deeper into how and why forms work. In particular, you'll go over the dos and don'ts of form design.

Call class back to attention. Hopefully, everyone feels a bit refreshed.

Say: *If you are thinking to yourself, "Forms are harder than I thought," know that UX/UI takes a lot of practice, and we are responsible for not making inferior forms.*

### Dos and Don'ts

Building interactions are about thinking through every step the user takes with a UI system.

- **Do** make required fields obvious.
  - Define the required fields.
  - Make forms legible.
  - All forms get labels.
- ***Don't*** clear forms on refresh.
- **Do** help complete forms over time.
  - Use autofill.
  - Decrease task abandonment.
- **Do** let the user know what percentage of the form is complete.
- ***Don't*** use multiple columns.
  - Users often omit fields if they are in more than one column.
  - It's easy for users to misinterpret field relationships in multiple column formats.
- **Do** split up lengthy forms into form wizards.
  - UX is helping to reduce the user's cognitive load.
- ***Don't*** use red asterisks to indicate the required fields.
  - Users associate negative emotions with the color red.
  - Most forms have required fields.
- **Do** add error-finding queues.
  - The user will not always complete, as asked.
- ***Don't*** use too much text or color for calls to action (CTAs).
  - Confusing CTAs cause cognitive overload in users.
  - CTAs are successful when they're no-brainer-level obvious.
- **Do** use autofill to help complete forms.

> :briefcase: As UX/UI designers, you will build a lot of UI form prototypes. Becoming skilled at them now will speed up your on-the-job performance. Add UI form prototyping to your resume skills and LinkedIn skills profile.

Now, take forms a step further by showing students how designers use Figma/Adobe XD to create forms.

## 12. Instructor Do: Demo - Mobile UI Forms (15 min)

Time to demo building a sign-up form in Figma/Adobe XD.

> **Instructor Note:** We are in the process of designing resources for Figma. If you are skilled enough, demo it on your own. We recommend using material UI kits to speed up your demo.

**Instructions**

1. Download the form starter file: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=166ly1As3uu9GVdIKIwxQ8CGWFMS_nLH5](https://drive.google.com/open?id=166ly1As3uu9GVdIKIwxQ8CGWFMS_nLH5).

2. Select the sign-up button on artboard 1 and click and drag to artboard 2. Set the trigger to tap and the action to auto-animate.

9. Select artboard 1, press play, and demo the form.

> **Instructor Note:** Let's take a moment to check in with the class and see how comfortable they're feeling with the topic we just covered.

Students are now ready to get hands-on and design forms in Adobe XD or Figma in the next activity.

## 13. Student Do: Mobile UI Form Prototype Activity (25 min)

**TAs:** Slack out to students the following file in the #_in_class_chat channel:

- [10-Week/02-Activities/10.3/10.3-03-UI-Low-Fidelity-Form-Prototype-Activity Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SEStM3ICpl1c0GgwOrtfdTQUSPGwapHXGFeJaEMNNew)

- [Figma-10.3-03-UX-Login-UI-Template](https://www.figma.com/file/D0MzOP1ZKXimUBXZzq3Bdk/10.3-03-UX-Login-UI-Template)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Students will be working individually, so keep all students in the main Zoom room and have them share their screens. Use one or two breakout rooms if students need individual help. Have students request help via Slack. Assign a TA to the one-on-one breakout room. During the review, take volunteers to highlight.

**Instructor and TAs:** Monitor students and offer to help those struggling to assemble UI form prototypes.

- Set a timer and help teams make progress.

- When half the alotted time for the activity has passed, unmute and let students know. Alternatively, feel free to screen share a countdown timer. One is available on Google by searching timer.

*Tips for students who struggle*: With TAs, look for students not importing their sketches into Figma/Adobe XD. Work with students to help them execute.

*For students who finish early*: It shouldn't be a problem, but have them research more UI form best practices and execute them in their prototype.

**Summary**

Students will turn their sketched forms into interactive prototypes using Figma/Adobe XD. As a bonus step, students will recreate their mobile UI form prototypes using the material design kit for Figma/Adobe XD.

**Instructions**

Working individually, students will complete the two-part activity.

**Part 1: Digitize UI form artboards in Figma/Adobe XD (20 min).**

First, students will import their sketches into Figma/Adobe XD and create multiple artboards for the form‚Äôs screen states and fields.

**Part 2: Prototype UI form in Figma/Adobe XD (5 min).**

Students will link their screens together using Adobe XD prototype to make their Adobe XD artboards interactive. Next, they'll use the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button‚Äù to test their prototype.

As a bonus, students can enhance their prototype with micro-interactions and animations.

**Deliverable**

Students will share in Slack a screenshot of their form prototype.

## 14. Instructor Do: Mobile UI Form Prototype Activity Review (10 min)

**TAs:** Slack out the mobile UI form solution file into the #resources channel to students: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RdyW6QvBTgwSX0ggwZQ4vRHyTT1gaL5u](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RdyW6QvBTgwSX0ggwZQ4vRHyTT1gaL5u).

Call attention back to the front of the room, then lead a discussion of the class's mobile UI form prototypes.

> globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**: Invite students back to the main Zoom room to review and discuss their work.

- Invite a student to share their prototype and engage the class in a discussion and critique.

- **Ask the following:**
  - What did you want the user to do with your form?
  - What value does this form have for the business?
  - Why did you go about asking your users for this content?
    - Discuss other observations that feel pertinent.

- Provide students with a few pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their UI form prototype work. For example:

  - Be mindful of form scanability‚Äîcan a user complete it quickly? Always ask, "What is really necessary? What isn't?"
  - Look for spacing and typography issues and call for iterations.

- Finally, discuss any **common misconceptions and FAQs** about the UI form prototypes. For example:

  - "Simple forms don't need to be prototyped." *False.* There are a lot of decisions and assumptions being made on a form. Validate with your users. Remember, always be testing and iterating (ABTI). 

> üíé **Designer Insight:** If the form prototype idea needs further explanation, invite one of your TAs to share a personal story about building UI forms, or share a story of your own.

- Take questions.
  - You have covered a lot, and you're at the end of the class‚Äîtake a moment to see if there are any final questions. Use the 30-second trick: Ask, *Who has a question?* Count silently to 30. (A question always arises!)

## 15. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (2 min)

You did it!

**Review the concepts.**

Spend a couple of minutes helping students anchor today‚Äôs learning by asking them to raise their hands‚Äîor post answers in Slack‚Äîand offer definitions for the following concepts from today's class:

1. Ask a few students to list the five button states.
- Answer: normal state, focused state, hover state, active/pressed state, and disabled/inactive state.

2. Ask a few others to describe why those states are essential to UI.
- Answer: Your user is learning your interface, and keeping your buttons consistent will help them use your buttons' affordances effectively.

3. Ask how many can recall the best practices for buttons.
- Answer: Button sizes should be minimum 44px in height and width.

4. Ask them to recall the best practices for mobile UI forms.
- Answer: Make forms 1 column and always include labels with error states.


- Tell students they'll need to use these skills we just practiced for the weekly challenge, so don't procrastinate!
- Everyone should be adding to their Adobe XD/Figma/InVision prototypes and making progress on their challenge.


### Office Hours

Remind students that you're holding office hours after class to help them. 

Take questions and wish everyone a good night.
