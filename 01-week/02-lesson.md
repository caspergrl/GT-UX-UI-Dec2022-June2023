# 1.2 Lesson Plan: User Research

---

## Overview

In the last class, you introduced students to the concept of design thinking and began the empathize phase of the design process. Today, you’ll introduce the fundamental skills of user research, which students will reinforce with in-class activities. We will improve our design empathy by creating proto-personas, applying the Five Whys, and conducting user interviews.

**UX Boot Camp Design Process**

This boot camp takes inspiration from lean, agile, and design thinking processes. Due to constraints, we've found a lean process that follows design thinking most effective for teaching. If you're unfamiliar with Lean User Experience (UX), we suggest reviewing the following media or books:

- [Lean V Agile V Design Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4VPfmtwRac)
- [UX for Lean Startups](https://www.amazon.com/UX-Lean-Startups-Experience-Research/dp/1492049581/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=lean+ux&qid=1583869742&s=books&sr=1-4)
- [Lean UX: Designing Great Products With Agile Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Designing-Great-Products/dp/1491953608/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=lean+ux&qid=1583869697&s=books&sr=1-2)

**The in-class activities are additive.**

All of the in-class activities are additive, with each day building on the prior. For example, in today’s lesson, students will conduct user interviews. In the next class, students will *use this research interview data* to create an affinity diagram and, ultimately, a user persona.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

1. Discern the appropriate use of question types during a user interview—using open and probing questions and avoiding leading, rhetorical, and closed questions.

2. Research and write an interview plan that includes a list of 20 or more questions.

3. Use a user research interview plan to conduct a user interview with a peer.

---

## Class at a Glance

Welcome to Lesson 1.2, which is about user research. It is divided into three parts:

1. Learning about proto-personas
2. Understanding question types
3. Conducting user interviews

***Students must conduct one user interview by the end of the day.***

They will use their user interview data in the next class for affinity diagrams and user personas.

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

### Instructor Notes

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”


## Preparing for Class

**Review the slides beforehand**.
- [01-Week/01-Slides/01.2-User Research Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TBVvWCvQenbIaX7HTZ8VQ-7BA0fYpmTikoXFC38ALUk/edit?usp=sharing)

- Make any teaching notes you'll need.

- As you lecture, relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future goals.

- Look for the :gem: icon, which prompts you and/or a TA to share professional anecdotes directly related to a particular concept.

- **Introducing the Challenge**
  Today will be the first time you introduce the challenge to the class. Review the challenge document carefully. At the end of today's class, you'll be summarizing the challenge for the students and addressing their questions

- **Read all activity instructions in advance.**
Students will be able to dive into their activities if you provide verbal guidance, so take time to familiarize yourself with today's activities.
- Once you're in class, you can rely on the activity summaries, which you'll find in the activity sections of every lesson plan.

- **Prepare to encourage collaboration.**
Think ahead about encouraging your class to work in breakout rooms, whether in pairs or groups. Group work will help them move through activities and prepare them for teamwork as a designer.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Today's Objectives (2 min)

Welcome the students to class.

Open and download today's slides. TAs should share them with the students via Slack: [01-Week/01-Slides/01.2-User Research Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TBVvWCvQenbIaX7HTZ8VQ-7BA0fYpmTikoXFC38ALUk/edit?usp=sharing).

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Start with a warm-up to engage your class and to get everyone energized and kick off the class.

Today's focus is on the design thinking process. Students will practice design thinking by starting the process off with the empathize phase and creating a proto-persona, writing an interview plan, and conducting user interviews.

- Generate students' interest in the overarching idea of user research by posing a few questions. For example:
  - *Can you think of an app that you found really irritating or hard to use?*
  - *Or had a hard time locating a product on a store's website?*
  - *Have you ever thrown a dinner party—or ordered a lot of pizzas—and had to ask everyone about their food preferences?*
  - Students should keep these experiences in mind during today's lesson.

> :gem: **Student insight:** Invite a couple of students to share their experiences with "interviewing" friends about their food preferences or having a hard time locating a product on a website.

- Connect today's lesson to the design thinking process. For example:

  - User research is fundamental to design thinking and UX. In the first phase of the design thinking process, we'll grow our empathy skills by thinking about and talking to our users, as well as gathering qualitative data from as many sources as possible.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Briefly share how asking questions has become a part of your design work.

- Today's learning objectives.
  - Share your screen and walk through today's learning objectives with the class.

Now that you've primed student's minds for today's learning, move on to your first lecture.

## 2. Instructor Do: User Research and Stakeholders (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Let's start on the right foot and make sure all students get up to speed on the importance of empathy in human-centered design as you communicate the importance of user research in the design process.

Start with prompting students to think about what's at stake for designers and their users. Then walk through the key research methods.


> **Say:** How are you doing user experience if you are not talking to users? How do you design what they want if you don't know what they want?


**Why does user research matter?**

Empathizing with your users is at the core of design thinking. If you don't have an understanding or awareness of how people see, feel, experience, and interact with things, you'll find that your designs will fall short of their potential.

This can result in creating designs that are not relevant to users, or designs that are not easy or pleasurable to use. User research places people at the center of the design process and products. It is used to inspire and inform your designs, to evaluate your solutions, and to measure the impact of your design.

UX design is a human-first way of designing products, putting the user at the center, and creating products that provide meaningful and personally relevant experiences to users.

This involves improving a product's usability, accessibility, and the pleasure people will get from using it.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share your own insight into why user research matters, based on your professional experiences. Alternatively, invite a TA to share.
>

**Three Categories of User Research**

We can put user research into three categories. The user research and testing process isn’t always linear, however, so it’s quite common to mix up the order below based on your needs (e.g., you could start with usability testing for a redesign).

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** As you review the following user research categories, feel free to support the validity of each with a professional anecdote. We want the real-world relevance of what they're learning to resonate with.

1. **Preliminary user research**: As the name suggests, preliminary user research happens before the actual hands-on design. Supported by primary and secondary sources.

   - Primary sources are original documents like eyewitness accounts, observations, interviews, records, etc. or empirical scholarly works such as research articles, clinical reports, case studies, dissertations.

   - Secondary sources describe, summarize, or discuss information or details originally presented in another source; meaning the author, in most cases, did not participate in the event.

   - Use secondary sources to obtain an overview of a topic and/or identify primary resources

2. **Usability testing**: Once the design process starts, you can initiate general usability testing. At this stage, you’re exploring the structure and functionality of the design.

3. **Refinement/Fine-tuning**: As the design process nears completion, you can begin fine-tuning with additional usability testing. More often than not, this stage tests the validity of decisions that you have already made.

### Qualitative User Research.

Qualitative research involves collecting and analyzing non-numerical data (e.g., text, video, or audio) to understand concepts, opinions, or experiences. It can be used to gather in-depth insights into a problem or generate new ideas for research.

Review a few methods

- One-on-one interviews (todays focus)
- Stakeholder interviews
- Focus groups
- Ethnographic research
- Field/Observational studies
- Participatory design
- Diary Studies

### Qualitative Research = High Touch time with Users 

Qualitative User Research is associated with high touch customer service. As UX designer there is no replacing talking and listening to your users face to face.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a quick story of interviewing users.

### Quantitative User Research.

Quantitative research is the process of collecting and analyzing numerical data. It can be used to find patterns and averages, make predictions, test causal relationships, and generalize results to wider populations.

Review a few methods

- Quantitative usability testing 
- App analytics
- A/B testing or multivariate testing
- Card sorting
- Tree testing
- Surveys or questionnaires (Today's focus)
- Clustering qualitative Comments
- Desirability studies
- Eye-tracking testing

### Data Analytics.

Quantitative User Research is associated with data (numbers, percents, tends, clicks, likes, etc.) As UX designer it is very hard to not allow data to validate or diagnose problems.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share a quick story of using quantitative data.

### Prelimiary User Research.

The goals of qualitative preliminary research are:

- Decide which user groups to target.
- Understand the preferences of the targeted user group (persona creation).
- Gauge the viability of your product in the market.
- Reveal ways to increase the value of your product in the market (product definition).

### Preliminary Research Methods.

1. **User interviews**: User interviews are among the oldest, most reliable methods of user research. User interviews are a direct approach to getting inside your user’s head.

2. **Surveys**: User surveys are faster and require less involvement at the cost of depth. These written questionnaires can be distributed online with tools such as Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey.

3. **Field studies**: Field studies examine users' behavior in their environment.

4. **Diary studies**: A diary study draws on a text written by the user for data.

**User Research Process**

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Use these slides to share your personal experience with the research process or what it looks like at your company.

Review the user research chart with your class. Today, we'll focus on three parts of this process:

- Research objectives
- Discussion guide
- User interviews

**Research in the Product Design Process**

Successful products are created by designers who know their users. While design processes vary based on the project needs, a loose outline of fitting user research into the process might include preliminary user research, user persona creation, product definition, wireframing, mockups, prototype testing, and coding (see the Research in the Product Design Process slide).

**User Interviews**

User interviewing isn’t merely chatting with people. It’s not just asking them what they like and dislike. User interviewing is about trying to get to the core of what a user is trying to do and what their problems are. User interviewing needs to be approached with proper rigor and respect. A lot of people think a user interview is just an informal chat with a person to run an idea or prototype past them. This is false.

- User interviews need to be rigorous. The questions need to be well thought out and purposeful, otherwise, you won’t get data worth acting upon. The only thing worse than no data is bad data.

- User interviews are a foundational user-centered design method that is best early on in the process, before you have an idea and prototypes. Usability testing and other methods are better for getting feedback from users on prototypes later on in the design process.

- User interviewing is an excellent method for figuring out users’ problems. User-centered design and design thinking are all about making sure we identify the correct problems and then figuring out how to solve them for people.

**User Interviews Help Us Diagnose Problems**

The first part of the double diamond design framework is to figure out what the true problem is. Product managers and others will often give you symptoms, not the actual problem. User interviews can help make sure you are solving for the correct problem.

**When to interview?**

- Before you have a design—in the early phase of developing a concept or product—to inform personas, journey maps, feature ideas, and workflows.

- To enhance a field study by supplementing observation with descriptions of tools, processes, bottlenecks, and how users perceive them.

- At the end of a usability test, to collect responses related to observed behaviors.

**How many interviews?**

- There’s no single correct number. Start with five interviews and increase up to five more, depending on domain complexity.

- The Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) says that five usability test subjects will yield 80% of the problems.

- **TAs,** slack out the following links for students to review after class:
  - [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/)
  - [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1525822X05279903](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1525822X05279903)
  - [http://www.mit.edu/~hauser/Papers/Gaskin_Griffin_Hauser_et_al%20VOC%20Encyclopedia%202011.pdf](http://www.mit.edu/~hauser/Papers/Gaskin_Griffin_Hauser_et_al%20VOC%20Encyclopedia%202011.pdf)

**User Interview Process**

The interview process follows four steps:

1. Define a research goal.
2. Plan the interview.
3. Conduct the interview.
4. Analyze the interview data.

Today, we'll focus on steps 1 through 3. The next class will cover Step 4.

## 3. Instructor Do: Research Objectives (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** User research is its own discipline in the UX umbrella therefore explain how research objectives are used to kick off user research.

Begin by introducing ways to clarify a research objective, then look at both good and bad examples of research objectives.

**What is a research objective?**

A ***research objective*** is a statement that communicates what your research hopes to achieve or the question you hope to answer.

Before you write an interview plan, you need to define your main objectives for doing the research. These objectives will inform the hypothesis and methods used during the research planning process. Often a research plan is shared with other stakeholders to get buy-in (i.e., a budget) to do the research. Essentially, the objectives drive the entire project, as they are the questions we want to answer.

When planning a research objective, you might:

- Ask yourself, “What am I trying to learn? What must the research achieve?”
- Identify what stage of the idea is being researched (prototype, concept, etc.).
- Talk to your team to align with what they want to learn.

**Review a research objective example.**

Let's say that you want to understand how people make travel decisions to improve that decision-making process.

So, you might brainstorm some objectives and decide that you want to learn:

- How people currently make travel decisions
- Why they decide to travel, who else is involved, when do they travel, where do they travel to, and how do they travel
- What tools people use to make travel decisions

Knowing precisely what you're researching will help you refine your research objectives. Once you have objectives, you can approach your team to ask them:

- What do they want to learn from the research project?
- What do they expect from the research?

**Bad vs. Good Research Objectives.**

Review the examples on the Bad vs. Good Research Objectives slide.

1. Objective Example 1: Find out how to get participants to buy flight insurance.
    - Discussion: We don’t want to find out how to get someone to do something. Besides, how would we ask good questions to get that information? We're more interested in learning what a user's thought process might be behind purchasing flight insurance, and if or why they have used it in the past.

2. Objective Example 2: Find out why people use Expedia to book travel.
    - Discussion: This could be helpful if Expedia is a tool your users frequently use instead of your platform. However, it's better to first ask, in general, what kind of other tools are used, so you're not hyper-focused on one tool and miss other opportunities to explore.

**Objectives Frame Research Questions**
Research objectives frame generative research questions. Your questions should be able to give you insights that answer your objectives. So when you ask a participant a question, it is ultimately answering one of the objectives. Turn each objective into three to five questions.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share examples from your own work with design teams of "good" and "bad" research objectives and how that impacted the outcome of your research.
>
> - If time allows, ask a TA to share, too.

**TAs,** slack out an IDEO case study on designing a voting system for students to review at their leisure:

  - [https://www.ideo.com/case-study/a-new-way-to-vote-for-the-people-of-los-angeles](https://www.ideo.com/case-study/a-new-way-to-vote-for-the-people-of-los-angeles)

> **Instructor Note:** Pause and take any questions before moving into the activity.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Exit the present mode in Zoom to get the student grid of faces for any questions. Practice calling on individual students by name to make sure everyone is with you.

Next we will be starting the first part of a longer activity today for practicing user research and interviewing. Remind students to follow along and use Slack if they are stuck or blocked by anything.

## 4. Student Do: User Interview - Part 1: Write a Research Objective (8 min)

:watch: 8 min :busts_in_silhouette:Individual Work :pencil: User Research Plan Template

**TAs,** slack out the activity instructions to the students:
- [01-Week/02-Activities/01.2/01.2-03-User-Interview-Google-Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tlzkLFa2joVO1rERQN2RGRazXOMhcd9ZvsebRHdYvNU/edit?usp=sharing)

> ***Note: The instructions cover all three parts of the activity.***

**Instructions**

This is the first part of a longer activity. Students will be working individually and then sharing.

- Set a timer for eight minutes.
- Have students all create a new Google Doc and share their screens in Zoom.
- Students should use the Madlib format to help generate research objectives.

**Instructor and TAs**

Support the students by looking alert and using Slack to direct message (DM) students who are not hitting the ground running.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have everyone share their screen and highlight

- TAs troubleshoot any student who is behind or needs help. Use Slack to DM the students.

**Deliverable**

- A Google Doc with a Madlib research objective

## 5. Instructor Do: Research Objective Review (5 min)

Bring attention back to your screen and lead a review that aims to give students an understanding of why their research objective is good or bad.

First, lead a review of the objectives.

- Remind students to post their research objectives in Slack.

- > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Share your screen.
- Scroll through the research objectives in Slack, and open up 2-3 to discuss.

- Invite the relevant students to read their objective aloud.
- Invite the class to critique the objective:
  - Students can use Zoom's raise-hand feature to provide feedback.
  - Invite the TAs to provide a critique as well.

Next, provide students with a couple of pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work after class. For example:

- Making sure research objectives are measurable.
- Share the SMART acronym: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely.

Finally, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about formulating research objectives. For example:

- A research team should only research one objective at a time. Although focus in user research is useful, in the real world a user research team will have multiple objectives running at the same time. This makes writing strong research objectives even more important.

- Research objectives are locked. False user research is more like a meandering stream than a laser targeted missile, but having a SMART research objective will help create a stronger path to walk for you and your team.

> **Instructor Note:** Take any questions students have, then move on to your discussion of interview question types.

## 6. Instructor Do: Question Types (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is for students to distinguish question types and get a sense of how they can use open and probing questions strategically during interviews. This lecture supports today's first learning objective, which is for students to discern the appropriate use of question types during a user interview—using open and probing questions and avoiding leading, rhetorical, and closed questions.

Guide students through the different types of questions designers use in the real world to get the best user input they can, and point out your own professional experience with the various question types as you define them.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As professional designers, they'll use a variety of question types to elicit meaningful user information. Asking good questions is essential to being a designer. 

**Types of User Interviews**

There are three types of interviews a design team uses: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Today, we'll conduct a semi-structured interview. To write an interview plan, you'll need to understand question types.

- Structured interviews are characterized by their carefully scripted questions. No follow-up questions are asked. For example:
  - When a lawyer or politician asks questions during a deposition.

- Semi-structured interviews are characterized by a more conversational tone and output. They are often used in design projects. The interviewer will have a few questions prepared. These questions are generally open-ended to encourage the participant to talk. For example:
  - Open-ended: Why did you come to the website today?

- Unstructured interviews are characterized by off-the-cuff conversations. The interviewer does not prepare questions. For example:
  - An interviewer would ask an open-ended question like, "Tell me about your experience planning vacations."

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share your experience using any of these three question types. Alternatively, invite a TA to share.
>

**Two question categories: open or closed.**
There are several types of questions, which can be divided into one of two categories: open or closed questions.

> **Instructor Note:** The following question types appear in the next activity, as well as this week's challenge.

**Closed questions:**

- Invite a short, focused answer.
- Are usually answered with a "Yes" or "No.""
- Examples: "Do you smoke?" "Did you feed the cat?"
  - Ask a TA to share an example of a real-world closed question a design team would ask.

- A user researcher and interviewer want to avoid closed question types.

**Open questions:**

- In contrast to closed questions, open questions allow for much longer responses and, therefore, potentially more creativity and information.
- Example: "What is it like to live in America?"
  - Ask a TA to share an example of a real-world open question.

***There are several kinds of open question types:***

- There are several types of open questions.

  - **Probing questions:** Asking a probing question will help you get to the bottom of things when you need more in-depth information. Example: "Where in Spain did you travel?"

  Open and probing questions are "good" question types. The next two are types you should try to avoid:

  - **Leading questions:** Suggests a particular answer to the interviewee. Example: "How much did you like amazon.com?"

  Ask class:

  - Why do you think leading questions are "bad"?

    - *Answer: Leading questions manipulate your audience to answer in a particular way.*

  - What professions are barred from using leading questions?

    - *Answer: Trial lawyers. Leading questions get struck from the court record.*

  - **Rhetorical questions:** Questions that are posed to make a point rather than be answered. Also, a question with an obvious answer. Example: "Is there anything more miserable than a long web form?"

*There are several types of open questions. However, there is only one type of closed question, which is a question that can be answered yes/no.*

**Why "Funnel" Questions?**

We can use intelligent questioning to essentially funnel—or guide—the respondent’s answers.

If you start with open questions and end with closed questions, you are guiding the user from general, information-rich answers to specifics.

If you start with closed questions and end with open questions, you are getting specifics from the user first, then elaborating on those answers with questions that extract more information.

**An example of open-to-closed questioning:**

- "Tell me about your most recent holiday."

- "What did you see while you were there?"

- "Were there any good restaurants?"

- "Did you try some local delicacies?"

- "Did you try the lobster?"

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how you've used open, closed, or funnel-type questions in your work with clients and users. Invite TAs to share as well.
>

**Sum it up.**
Students are nearly ready to write interview questions! Students have now added another set of question types to their interview toolkit along with the Five Whys.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause and make sure there aren't any questions and everyone is on the same page.

## 7. Student Do: Question Types | Quiz (8 min)

:watch: 8 min :busts_in_silhouette: Class :pencil: Zoom's chat feature

This fun quiz will strengthen students' grasp of question types.

> :globe_with_meridians: Students can use the Zoom chat feature to text you privately—only you—with their answers.

**Instructor, begin the quiz:**

- Open the **"Question Types Quiz"** slide.
  - Be sure you are sharing your screen.

- Remind students to send you a private text in Zoom with their *numbered answers*.
  - For example: "1 closed, 2 leading, etc."
- Show the slide AND read the quiz questions aloud.

- Once three minutes are up, read the answers to the class.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation** Ask students who got 100% right answers to hold up their hands for a "virtual" high-five.

**Discuss how to "fix" the questions.**

Ask: How would you rewrite these questions to be more open or probing?

- Looking at the closed and leading questions, take student volunteers who can suggest how to "fix' the questions. 
> :globe_with_meridians: If students don't readily volunteer, pick ones at random.
  - Example: Do you enjoy your car? (leading question) ► Why do you drive a car?
  - Example: Are you satisfied? (leading and closed) ► Can you tell me a time you were satisfied with a product?
  - Example: Do you like using the internet? (leading, rhetorical, and closed) ► When was the last time you used the internet, and for what?

**Ask students the following:**

> :globe_with_meridians: Students can raise their hands in front of their camera to answer, or post answers in Slack.

- What tells you that a question is closed? (Yes/No)
- How do you know that a question is rhetorical?
- What makes a closed question *leading?* (Emotion)

**QUIZ Answer key:**

- Are you satisfied? *Closed question*.
- Do you enjoy your car? *Leading question*.
- Did it act as you expected? *Closed question*.
- Do you like using the internet? *Leading question*.
- Is it wrong to steal candy from a baby? *Leading question (but rhetorical is acceptable)*.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause and make sure there aren't any questions and everyone is on the same page.

## 8. Instructor Do: How to Write an Interview Plan and Discussion Guide (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to help students appreciate that taking the time to write a solid interview plan always pays off. This lecture supports today's second learning objective, which is for students to research and write an interview plan that includes a list of 20 or more questions.

Here, you will walk through the process of planning an interview, looking for opportunities to relate your professional experience where it is relevant.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As professional designers, they will need to have a clear idea of how they want an interview to unfold before they walk into that interview.

**Slow your roll.**

- Designers spend a lot of time writing interview questions to conduct smooth interviews.
- When preparing for a user interview, "measure twice, cut once" is an excellent rule of thumb.
- Remind students: "Embrace the process; there's no rush."

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Relate your experience with learning to take your time with the interview process.
>
> - Ask students to share if they've had the experience of being part of an interview process.

**There are five steps to create a user interview plan.**

1. **Define the interview objective.** You should know what you want to be answered. For example:

   - “Why do people make purchases online?”
   - “How do people make purchases online?”
   - “What’s the difference between online and offline purchasing for the consumer?”

2. **Identify your interviewees.** You should be able to identify who your target user is. We've done this earlier by creating our proto-persona.

3. **Prepare a list of questions.**

   - Don’t ask leading questions.
   - Ask about specific incidents in the past when possible.
   - Ask open-ended questions.
   - You can ask more than one question to find out the same thing.

4. **Give the whole list of questions a structure**, including an introduction, warm-up questions, main body questions, and wrap-up questions.

5. **Conduct and record the interview.**
How to conduct a user interview:
   - Before beginning the interview, **make the user feel as comfortable as possible.**
   - Greet them and thank them for taking the time to do this interview. Introduce yourself and provide some project background.

**Discussion Guides**

Discussion guides serve two important purposes:

1. They facilitate communication between the moderator and the client by clarifying the flow and the amount of emphasis placed on each topic.

2. They serve as a quick-reference tool for the moderator while conducting the research.

**A Discussion Guide Contains Many Question Types**

Asking the right questions during user research, interviews, and testing is an art form. A good discussion guide is arguably the most important part of your testing plan.

Interviewers do the hard pre-work of developing questions, remembering to ask Five Whys, and scheduling when, where, and how they're going to talk with a user so that it is more comfortable when they conduct their conversations.

- You must have defined objectives.
- The "objectives" are the questions you are trying to answer.
- Ask yourself:
  - *"What do I need to know at this point in the design process?"*
  - *"What are the knowledge gaps we need to fill?*

- Know your objective and write questions that will get you there.

**How to Structure Interviews**

An interview has three acts, like a play: the introduction and warm-up, the body of the interview, and the conclusion.

1. Beginning: This is when we ask warm-up questions.
2. Middle: This is when we ask the main questions.
3. End: This is when we wrap up the interview and ask any follow-up questions.

**Create an Interview Team**

It’s best to conduct an interview accompanied by a partner. The ideal user interview takes place with two UX researchers and one participant.

**On Being an Active Listener**

Ask students, "What makes you feel like someone is listening to you?" "How would you define active listening" "Why is this an important skill?"

- **Let users ask questions.** Make some small talk and ask if they have any questions before you begin.

- **Record the interview.** Be sure to ask your interviewee if they agree to be recorded and tell them that the recording will only be used for project purposes. It's best to use a combination of audio, video, and written notes.

- Embrace silence.

- Ask people to summarize their thoughts.

- Ask follow-up questions.

- Don’t push for a specific answer.

**After the Interview**

After interviews, designers take the time to analyze their findings and see how they relate to their initial expectations. Consider the following questions:

- What gaps in knowledge have you uncovered that you need to research?

- Does what you’ve learned change how you should frame the research objective?

- Is there a pattern in the data that suggests new design considerations?

**Sum it up.**
Great user interviews stem from thoughtful questions that designers take time to develop and from keeping interviewees relaxed. Interviewing is a tough process, so let’s practice together before doing it on our own for the challange assignment.

> **Instructor Note:** Pause and make sure there aren't any questions and everyone is on the same page.

## 9. Instructor Do: Design Critique (5 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to help students understand the value and importance of critique for designers in the workplace.

Set the stage for an open, engaged, and safe environment for sharing work and critiquing it. As the instructor, there is a lot you can do to set the tone for an open, creative critique environment. For example:

- Use positive language. "This is a great, great start", "That X is insightful did you consider Y?"
- Use open body language. "Smile, don't frown, and take in the solution before responding to the first issue.

Quickly review the design critique slides.

**This classroom is a safe space for feedback.**

- The right facilitation process can foster an iterative feedback loop. Design is a team effort. To improve designs, we need feedback. Good designers need to learn to take feedback from their teammates, clients, and bosses to solve design problems.

**Great designers justify every decision they make.**

- Learning to think like a designer doesn’t happen overnight. In design, we don’t often have an easy answer to what is right or wrong. Designers strive to understand why another designer made a particular decision and then give feedback on what might improve the solution.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Feel free to share a "good" or "bad" critique experience with the class to help them value the importance of being an active critique participant. TAs may have anecdotes to share as well.
>

Wrap up by taking questions to be sure that students are clear on the design critique concept.

Next, students will get hands-on practice by developing their research plans.

## 10. Student Do: Activity Part 2: Develop the User Interview Plan (20 min)

:watch: 20 min :busts_in_silhouette: Groups of 3-4 :pencil: User Research Plan Template

> **Instructor Note:** Students continue to use the same instructions document.

**TAs:** Slack out the Sample Questions Document: [01.2-01.1-User-Interview-Sample-Questions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vDn65WqjnsoMYG4LWIM18ZaivWR1dHjKVAB72FAFxm8).

**Summary**

Get into a group of three to four people where students will collaborate on making a User Research Plan from a template. Students will discuss, define, and agree on your interview goal.

**Instructions**

- Put the team into Zoom breakout rooms. Work with TAs to separate students into groups.

- > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Prebuild breakout rooms and make sure all students are clear on their activity before launching them into to Zoon breakout rooms. Keep 1 group in the main room to preserve the class recording.

- **TAs** Share the User Research Plan Template in Slack. Tell groups to make a copy and than share among your group members.

  - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EWVam7d358BdHBTQUSGt4uFA_jYB-kyiH9G4caBsGSs/edit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EWVam7d358BdHBTQUSGt4uFA_jYB-kyiH9G4caBsGSs/edit)

- Set a timer for 20 minutes.
- Remind students to have it clear in their minds exactly what they want to get out of the interview as they write their questions.

**Instructor and TAs**

- Some students become overwhelmed or get stuck planning their questions. Providing context helps:
  - Remind them that this up-front work of preparing great questions, recruiting your interviewees, and having an interview plan is done in advance so that during the challenge interviews, they can be present, prepared, and successful in their user interviews.
  - Good questions lead to effortless interviews that generate meaningful data.

- > :globe_with_meridians: With your TA split up the groups and mix in give each group a couple minutes to get set up and than jump around checking in with each group and helping add questions.

- Remind students to **share their work in Slack**.

**Deliverable**

- User Research Interview Plan
- 15 to 20 open interview questions

## 11. Instructor Do: Interview Questions Review (10 min)

First, bring attention back to your screen to lead a review of the activity.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Don't share your screen; keep everyone in the main Zoom room.

- Aim to review the work of two to four student teams.

- Scroll through the work posted in Slack and choose one.
- The team who created the question will present their work:
  - Have one member of the team explain their teams' work.
- Then ask the class to provide a critique.
  - The class should follow the "I Like/I Wish" critique format and language:
    - *What did they think about the order of questions?*
    - *What do they think of the warm-up question?*
    - *How about the number of questions?*
    - *What about the types of questions?*
  - Ask the presenters:
    - *What did they learn?*
    - *Why did they choose certain questions?*
    - *What would they do differently?*
- Choose the next team to present and repeat the critique process.

Next, provide students with a couple of pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work. For example:

- There should be only open and probing questions. Any closed or leading questions should be rewritten.
- Not all questions are openers, so indicate which question might be good to start an interview with.
- Long, deep questions should be broken up.

Finally, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about formulating interview questions. For example:

- Good questions make for good interviews. Although they are very helpful, you still need good interview subjects who are open and willing to answer good questions. If your questions are not good, your answers will be lacking.

- The more you prepare, the better the interview. Interviewing is very hard, so don't think you will just be good at this—it will take a lot of practice.

- Even the best interviewers continue to refine their interview questions—even in the midst of an interview!

**TAs,** slack out the Customer Interview Script Template for students to review after class: 
- [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pxsWbtsYVOt6UYxV0o-IL7Er_laqbP3WB0sJAOy-I2k](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pxsWbtsYVOt6UYxV0o-IL7Er_laqbP3WB0sJAOy-I2k)

## 12. Student Do: Activity Part 2 (Continued): Final Task: Iterate the User Interview Plan (5 min)

:watch: 5 min :bust_in_silhouette: Work independently :pencil: User Research Plan Template

> **Instructor Note:** Students continue to use the same instructions document.

**Summary**

Here, students will take a few minutes to make changes based on the information and feedback from the review process and prepare to tackle user interviews in the next activity.

**Instructions**

- Students will be executing their plan, so allow them a moment to individually refine their own plan and questions.
- Set a timer for five minutes

**Instructor and TAs**

- Assist students by having them share their interview plan and their top opening question with you in Slack.

- *For students who struggle*: Open a breakout room and have them quickly walk through their plan and questions.

> :globe_with_meridians: Have everyone share their screen in Zoom to see if any students are struggling or need some help.

**Deliverable**

An individual interview plan with 10 good questions to ask.

## 13. Break (15 min)

> **Instructor Note:** Brain breaks support learning, so encourage everyone to take time to drink water or stretch. You, too!

Let students know that after the break, you'll cover planning and executing user interviews.

> :globe_with_meridians: Don't stop sharing your screen. Put up a Google timer or a YouTube timer video to help get students back into the Zoom room on time.

## 14. Instructor Do: Interview Dos and Don’ts (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to reinforce students' understanding of interview questions in preparation for their interview activity. This lecture supports today's third, and final, learning objective, which is for students to apply their user research plan to conduct a peer user interview.

As you walk students through the following interview best practices, share your professional insights to root this learning in the real world that students will one day be part of.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a human-centered designer or user researcher you will be expected to interface with your users and get feedback. Practicing and showing that you can tackle this challenging task will make you much more employable. User interviewing should be included on your resume and in your LinkedIn skills profile.

- Reassure students that although UX conversations/interviews can be challenging, the group will help one another write questions that will lead to successful interviews.

*> **Say:*** "Take notes. Let me repeat that: Take. Notes." Why? Students will be using their interview material in the coming weeks for several activities.

**Review and discuss the seven dos and don'ts.**

Initiate a casual group discussion of the Dos and Don'ts slides. Invite the TAs to take part.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** As you walk through the following Dos and Don'ts, share something about your interview preparation process. Have TAs share as well. 
>

1. Be conversational:

   - Interviews should not feel like interrogations. Does anyone like being grilled? (Of course not!) Make it friendly.

2. Rephrase questions:

   - First ask: *Tell me the last time you voted.* (No answer.) Then rephrase: *What would compel you to vote?*

3. Ask open-ended and probing questions:

   - Interviews are about getting your interviewee to reveal something insightful. Once you get your interview subject to tell a story, they will share insights.

4. Ask about their habits:

   - > **Ask:** "Why would asking users about habits be useful?"

   - Because: Habits drive behavior, and behavior leads to how users talk about the product.

   - Example: If a person leaves bad reviews on Yelp all the time, they are less likely to leave a good review.

5. Let silence be awkward:

   - Be quiet for 10 seconds (see if anyone in class picks up on the awkwardness).

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Practice being very silent and see your students reactions. Silence even online is not comfortable.

6. Discuss real incidents:

   - Ask the class: *If you were an astronaut, would you go to Mars or the Moon?*

   - That's NOT a relevant question. Try again.

   - Now ask the class: *"Tahiti is trending right now. As a student traveler, would you prefer to travel there, or some less talked about place?"*

7. Be as flexible as needed:

   - Allow the interview to go where it needs to go in the time that it takes.

   - For example, don't schedule interviews too tightly. Sometimes the longer, the better, as the juicy insights only get exposed over time. You will know when it's too short.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions, Pause for questions before moving onto the student activity.

### Tips for being an interviewer:

- As an interviewer, you will play host:
  - You want to begin an interview by putting the participant at ease with your demeanor.
  - The more comfortable a participant feels, the more they'll share, and in detail. A relaxed participant will open up and be more honest, less likely to worry about putting on a good impression.
  - Once you’ve done your part to get the subject talking, get out of the way:
    - You should strive to be a nearly invisible, neutral presence soaking up everything the other person has to say.
    - Think of your peer as the world’s foremost expert on themselves, which is the all-absorbing matter at hand.
    - Insert yourself only when necessary to redirect back on topic or get clarification. You will know when your interview is going particularly well because you won’t be able to get a word in, but you will be getting answers to all your questions.

Now it's time for students to test out their interview skills with an activity—that's next.

## 15. Student Do: Activity Part 3: Conduct the User Interviews (35 min)

:watch: 35 min :busts_in_silhouette: Pairs :pencil: Interview Questions

**TAs,** slack out a link to the [User Research Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EWVam7d358BdHBTQUSGt4uFA_jYB-kyiH9G4caBsGSs/edit#gid=1739878237).

> **Instructor Note:** Students continue to use the same instructions document.

**Summary**

Working in pairs, your students will put their well-developed interview questions to work as they interview classmates about their travel habits and behaviors.

**Instructions**

- Create breakout groups so that students work in pairs.
- Set a timer for 35 minutes.
  - Remind interview partners to listen and take notes and record their interviews using their phone or screen-recording software.

  - At the halfway mark, remind students to switch roles with their partners before time runs out.
- *For students who struggle*: Suggest they quickly reword a question, or use the Five Whys to break through.

**Instructor and TAs**

- > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Place pairs into breakout rooms, keep 1 pair in the main room. With the TAs jump into other breakout rooms and try to be a fly on the wall and just listen to how the interviews are progressing.
  
  - Be available for questions, but mostly just observe and let the process happen.
- Cheer them on for conducting their first user interviews via Slack.
- At 15 min send an @channel Slack message that interviews should switch soon.

**Deliverable**

- A user interview and recording

## 16. Instructor Do: User Interviews Review (5 min)

Bring everyone's attention back to your screen for a review of the activity.

> :globe_with_meridians: Bring everyone back to the main Zoom room. Don't share your screen; keep everyone in the main Zoom room.

First, invite two to three students to share their experience of conducting an interview. Aim to get them to think deeply about the interview process.

Questions to ask as students share their experiences:

- How did you know the interview was going well? (For example, good answers, interesting responses, laughter, smiles, and good body language.)

- Was the remote technology good or bad?

- Did anyone come up with questions on the spot? Or did you stick to your plan?

Then, lead a brief discussion about the interview methods of user research.

**Ask,** *"If we wanted to learn even more about our users, how could we do that?"*

Possible answers: students jumping to conclusions, not following up with good probing questions, and where the interviews stalled or didn't get them the results they expected.

Next, provide students with a couple of pieces of actionable feedback that they can apply directly to their work. For example:

- Interviews are not easy, but with practice, you will get better and better. Practicing a script and setting interview expectations go a long way in improving the outcomes.
- Watch other good interviewers. Listening to Charlie Rose, Terry Gross, Marc Maron, Ira Glass, and other interviewers' podcasts will help.

Finally, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about user interviews. For example:

- Interviewing is only for extraverts! False. If you want to be a good human-centered designer, you need to talk to your users regardless of where you fall on the extravert-introvert spectrum.
- Interviews are too expensive. Also false. It is about priorities. UX/UI designers are also expensive, but if we have the right process, we can drive a lot of value. Interviewing your users is always worth the time and effort.

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions, invite students to stay online for office hours, and then introduce the first challenge assignment.

## 17. Instructor Do: Introduce the Challenge (8 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to help generate excitement about the challenge and explain the connection between the challenge and in-class activities. This is the first challenge, so we want to set a strong foundation.

First, explain how the challenge works in our boot camp format. Then, introduce this week's challenge.

**About boot camp challenges.**

**The challenge is a Design Challenge.**

- Students will spend the next four weeks executing the design thinking process, uncovering pain points that people experience while making travel plans, and designing a mobile app solution to solve the problem.

- All challenge assignments are structured as a design challenge. Once we go through the user-centered design process, we create case studies to communicate the process. These case studies are how companies evaluate UX design candidates during the hiring process.

**Requirements and instructions:**

- Most UX designers are managed by a product or design manager. Challenge documents are structured similarly to a requirements document you might receive on the job.

**Challenges and organization:**

- Organization is really important during the boot camp. You will be creating a lot of UX/UI deliverables, and staying organized is critical. We suggest using Google Drive, but make sure to take time setting up your folder structure.

**Where to submit Challenges:**

- All challenges are to be submitted as a Google Slides deck inside a Google Drive folder. All your challenges build up toward a case study. If you do not submit a link to your case study, your challenge will be marked as incomplete.

- Your challenge is due the following week on the third lecture day. For example, Challenge 1 is due on the class day of Lesson 2.3. Challenge 2 is due on the class day of Lesson 3.3.

**Challenges are formatted as a case study to prepare students for the job market.**

- Challenge assignments are structured as a case study because all designers are required to submit a portfolio during the hiring process. A UX portfolio consists of case studies demonstrating your mastery of the user-centered design process.

- Case studies make it easier for us to help you. You have to submit a case study to practice the storytelling skill that is essential when sharing your work. It’s going to make you a better designer.

**This Week's Challenge**

**TAs,** Share the challenge instructions with students on Slack.

- [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4-Iwekrtps5YXM1pOHHZMrH8kZwJ9bR4ONVXG0znP4/edit#heading=h.ib5jh4hdbbr](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4-Iwekrtps5YXM1pOHHZMrH8kZwJ9bR4ONVXG0znP4/edit#heading=h.ib5jh4hdbbr)

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Mobile consumer app design skills are what companies and hiring managers want to see in portfolios today. If students can design something from scratch, they will also be able to figure out pain points in existing apps.

**Today's learning will help students do their challenge:**

- We highly recommend trying to get two or more interviews completed by the next class, so you have the interview data for executing the activities in the next class.

- Remind students to have the notes they took today handy when they begin their challenge assignment.

**Challenge benefits:**

- Your first design challenge starts today.
- All the challenge assignments in this course will help you build your portfolio!
- The next four weeks of challenges will lead you through an important design challenge that relies on the design thinking process.
- You will wear the hat of a user researcher and create:
  - Proto-personas
  - Research plans
  - User interviews
  - Affinity diagrams
  - Empathy maps
  - User personas
- Imagine you're a product designer, and you have to design and build a mobile app that solves a problem in the real world. That is a pretty overwhelming task, right? I can imagine you saying, "There's so much information! How do I know what to build? Where do I start?"
  - Big companies ask these questions every day.
  - To tackle this seemingly herculean task, you will break it down into steps.

- That's why this week's challenge is one week of a four-week project where you will be using the skills we learn throughout each week to practice the design process and make a solution and that builds on itself.

## 18. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (5 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Do a quick engagement to close out the day like a group high-five or clapping.

*You did it!*

Your students completed their second lesson and now have an understanding of the value of empathy in user research, how to establish research objectives and plan a user interview, why user research and interviewing is essential to discovering issues and experience with interviewing a classmate which enables you to take these skills and repeat them for your homework.

***Recap key concepts to help students ensure the important ideas are sinking in.***

- Invite students to use Slack to give their answers or use Zoom's raise-hand feature to respond to the following questions:
  - Why are open questions important when interviewing?
    - Answer: Because we want to hear about our users' experience and let them explore their emotions.
  - What is a great time to schedule an interview?
    - Answer: Consider your interviewers habits. They have to eat, so not during breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They have to sleep, so not too late or too early. Recommend around 8pm or between 2pm to 4pm

Next class, we'll enter the define phase of the design thinking process, where we'll synthesize our research and formulate a problem to solve.

> **Instructor Note:** Remind students **Don't procrastinate** on this challenge assignment! The quality students put in now will pay off later.

Invite students to stay online for office hours if they have any questions about the challenge or concepts from today's class.

Wish everyone a good night.
