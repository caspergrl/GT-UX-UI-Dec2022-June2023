# 1.3 Lesson Plan: Research Analysis and Definition

---

## Overview

In the last two lessons, students learned about creating proto-personas as a way to start ideating and getting to know their users, as well as a means for creating consensus. They also did a bit of user research and practiced the interviewing process. The focus was on the first phase of the design thinking process, *empathize/research phase.*

Today, you will teach students about the define phase of the design thinking process focused on research and analysis.

As a whole, Unit 1 enables students to conduct preliminary user research and research synthesis.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today’s class, students will be able to:

1. Create affinity diagrams from user interview data.

2. Build an empathy map using a proto-persona, user interviews, and affinity diagram data.

3. Execute a user persona and iterate based on the proto-persona, user interviews, empathy maps, and affinity diagram data.

4. Use a constructive approach to design critique and interpret the feedback.

## Class at a Glance

Today, your students are going to roll up their sleeves and get into the define phase and learn how to *synthesize the research data they generated in the previous class.*

> **Instructor Note:** Student should have their research data available send a friendly reminder via Slack before class to bring your research.

- Students will use the following tools for *synthesis* and work in the same groups for the entire class as they start with affinity diagrams. They'll use the affinity diagrams to generate empathy maps and user personas (a.k.a. the "real" version of a proto-persona). Synthesizing data can be a tricky business, and we believe it's important to expose students to both methods in relation to the same data set.

**Today's lesson covers:**

- Introducing the *define* phase of the design process
- Research synthesis
- Affinity diagrams
- Empathy maps
- User personas

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

### Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: > :globe_with_meridians:) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Transitions and activities tend to take longer in virtual classrooms. ***If you find that you are running short on time,*** feel free to combine activities and reviews by doing the activity as a class instead of creating breakout groups. 

## Preparing for Class

- Read through your slide deck for today's lecture: [01-Week/01-Slides/01.3-Analysis and Definition Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rSEpigSJXwZHgJzwawC0Lg34SSx9ILM-V4E-fgMeRzY/edit?usp=sharing).

- **Review the slides beforehand.**

Study your slides before class and make any teaching notes you'll need.

As you lecture, relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future goals. Look for the :gem: icons in the lectures below for key moments to share your insights.

- **Review the activity instructions now so that you can summarize them for students out loud in class.**

Students will be able to dive into their activities if you provide verbal guidance.

*There's no need to read the instructions word for word*, but do summarize the essential steps.

- **Think about how to structure group work.**

Encourage your class to work in pairs or groups. Group work will help them move through activities in class and learn from their peers, as well as prepare them for teamwork as a designer.

- **Prepare to remind students about the value of keeping up with the challenge.**

At the end of class, be sure to place a strong emphasis on keeping up on the challenge. Remind students that they'll get more out of each and every class if they keep pace with the lessons and their challenge.

- For example, TAs have shared links to reference material, tools, and articles for further reading. Students should review it all.

The weekly challenge is built with class lessons in mind—each week teaches them what they need to know to complete the challenge. Doing the challenge is how students get the deep learning they need by putting into practice all of the in-class material they're absorbing.

### Online Classes

Online classes require more effort in creating collaboration than in a traditional classroom space. Encourage your students to build a collaborative and engaging learning environment.

### Online Activities

We want to ensure all students work in pairs on activities to avoid isolation. Utilize breakout rooms in Zoom for these situations.

### Online Peer Review

Peer review is built into the curriculum as a way for students to practice giving constructive feedback in the classroom. This element will be challenging to mirror online. Be flexible and try a few approaches to find one that works for you:

1. Use review time to extend the activity time for students.
2. Let students try peer review and see how it goes. Adjust accordingly.
3. Add more time for reviews at the end of the activity.

We welcome your feedback on your online teaching challenges and breakthroughs.

## 1.Instructor Do: Welcome and Share Today's Objectives (5 min)

Welcome the students to class. 

Open and download today's slides. TAs should share them with the students via Slack: [01-Week/01-Slides/01.3-Analysis and Definition Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rSEpigSJXwZHgJzwawC0Lg34SSx9ILM-V4E-fgMeRzY/edit?usp=sharing).

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Engage the class, Start with a warm-up to raise the energy and shift their focus to the boot camp.

**Tools Designers Use on the Job**
The tools students will learn today are ones they'll regularly use as designers—starting with synthesizing user research and creating affinity diagrams. We use these skills throughout the design thinking process. And they are particularly useful at the beginning during the empathy and define phases.

**Welcome to the Define Phase**
The class learned to gather data and lead user interviews in the last class. Now it's time to focus on what to do with all of that user research and data.



## SLIDES 1-4
Review

## SLIDE 5
During the *define phase* of the design thinking process, designers develop valuable insights by analyzing all the data they collected during the *empathy/research phase*.

- *In the define phase, you analyze pain points and define the user and their problem. Remember, design thinking is not a linear process but a series of cycles, and the process folds back on itself as needed.*

- *Empathize*—through research
- *Define*—synthesizing research data into a problem statement (< YOU ARE HERE)
- *Ideate*—brainstorming potential solutions
- *Prototype*—experimenting to make the ideas tangible
- *Test*—testing and iteration

- **1. Empathize phase**: In the empathize phase, designers engage in user research by designing proto-personas and developing empathy for their users through qualitative and quantitative research data.

  - *Empathy synthesis*: In empathy synthesis, you'll use affinity diagrams and empathy maps to analyze your user research data. Each design thinking phase cycle requires synthesizing results as deliverables.

- **2. Define phase**: In the define phase, you create user personas from your synthesized data.

  - *Goal*: The goal of the define phase is to define the problem to begin the ideation phase.

As you move forward in the design thinking process, communicate how the process is additive. We'll use our empathy knowledge to help execute the define phase of the process through defining a problem.

**Proto-personas and user personas are two different things.**

- Proto-personas are based on a hypothesis—your best guess.
  - *Proto-personas are created before user research*
  - Remember, proto-personas are primitive, our "first draft" of the character.
- User personas are based on data, facts, and information gathered.
  - *User personas are created after user research.*

## SLIDE 6
Review

## SLIDE 7
Review _then_  
**The define phase—where you want to "live" as long as possible.**

- The designer has to make sense of the data and extract meaningful information from it to arrive at an actionable user problem and defined problem statement.

- Focusing on a specific user problem is why the define phase is incredibly important. You must analyze your user data to identify pain points using whatever data you have. Data about the company you're designing for is also important to gather and analyze. Defining the user problem—which is again the goal of the define phase—is looking for the overlap between the user needs and the business needs. This is essential for developing a great user experience and demonstrates your value to the design team.

** NOTE - this is another area where many companies will make product managers the "owners" of the problem and designers the "owners" of the solution. It's very important that this is a collaborative process though even if this is the case so design needs to know how to ask the right questions and tease out those root causes.

## SLIDE 8
Review

## SLIDE 9
**Research Synthesis**

After designers complete the user research step, their next job is to *synthesize* that research. Synthesis is the first action in moving into the define phase of the design thinking process.

**Research synthesis** means organizing, analyzing, and putting together data to form a fuller picture of the user.

- ***When?*** Designers do research synthesis at the beginning of the define phase of the design process—not until the data is organized and analyzed can the designer see the problem they're trying to solve.

- ***Why?*** Research synthesis is a great process to address any product- or process-related design issue to study and identify the problem.

**Triangulation**
- When you "triangulate" data, you're using a variety of data to study one topic. Each piece of data that you include contributes something to the overall picture.

- **Triangulation** is also known as "mixed-method research" because it mixes multiple market research methods to study one topic. The purpose of triangulation within market research is to increase the validity of a study. It involves combining both qualitative data (behavior) and quantitative data (facts) when studying an issue or phenomenon.

- Multiple perspectives help solve problems more accurately and efficiently. Combining different research methods (i.e., triangulating) is one of the most effective ways to gather multiple perspectives.

## SLIDE 10
**Affinity Diagrams**

1. **What it is:**

- The affinity diagram organizes a large number of ideas into their natural relationships. It is the organized output from a brainstorming session.
- Design teams use affinity diagrams to process, sort, and identify insights in data.

2. **When it is used:**

- After a brainstorming exercise
- When analyzing verbal data, such as survey results
- When collecting and organizing large data sets
- When developing relationships or themes among ideas

3. **Why it matters:**

- To generate, organize, and consolidate information related to a product, process, complex issue, or problem

Imagine that your team just completed 20 user interviews. During the interviews, you received a lot of feedback and user research data. The question now is, *How do you make sense of all that data?*

- The first step in making sense of the chaos of a ton of data is to organize it. That's where affinity diagrams come in.

- An **affinity diagram** is a tool for gathering large amounts of data and organizing them into groupings based on their natural relationships.

- To have affinity means "to like" or "to have a natural preference."

- **Why?** Affinity diagrams enable us to analyze and make sense of user research.

- **When** Affinity diagrams should be used during the define phase when you're ready to synthesize multiple types of data—such as user interviews.

- To reinforce learning, ask, **"Can someone remind us what the define phase is?"**

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share the define phase's dos and don'ts that you've learned while working in the design field.

**Affinity diagrams' benefits:**

- Create a process for analyzing research data.

- Reduce group bias—combining observations can weed out biases.

- Build consensus—combining ideas makes patterns visible and reveals how the group thinks.

- Make the team democratic—give teammates an equal voice.

- Bring themes and patterns to the surface—help with identifying user themes, patterns, and insights that inform the design direction.

Review

## SLIDE 12
Review

## SLIDE 13
The process has five steps:

1. **Prepare affinity sticky notes.**
   - Do this step after reviewing user interviews, observations, and other research. The first thing a designer does is gather all of their data together in one place, then write down all research facts/thoughts/ideas on the topic. (One idea per sticky note.)

## SLIDE 14
2. **Combine ideas and pull out categories.**
   - The fun part is writing key data points on sticky notes and sticking them to the wall. Designers put key data points onto a wall or whiteboard to create groupings of similar ideas.

## SLIDE 15
3. **Look for similarities and trends between categories.**
   - Adding labels to groups with similar ideas allows designers to begin drawing conclusions about the groups of data created. Designers look for similarities or overlapping ideas/research facts/thoughts among the sticky notes.

## SLIDE 16
4. **Label the categories.**
   - This is where designers group the ideas on sticky notes into categories. Designers group the sticky notes, then add labels to groups with similar ideas. From there, they begin to draw conclusions about the groups of data created.

## SLIDE 17
5. **(Bonus) Create a point of view statement for each group.**
   - *This puts the designer in the interviewee's shoes.*
    Designers summarize each category in one sentence, using the "I Like," "I Want," or "I Need" statements.

## 3. Student Do: Affinity Diagram Activity (45 min)

:watch: 45 minutes :busts_in_silhouette: Group work :pencil2: Miro

**:information_source: TAs please Slack out** these activity instructions: [01-Week/02-Activities/01.3/01.3-01-Affinity Diagram Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Su1fgad_DYzf5UnkQsECwRi1jtMJFgpRj_K-OiJGqk8/edit?usp=sharing).

**Summary**

This activity gives students practice handling large volumes of data in an organized fashion and training their brains to notice patterns across various research data. This is a highly collaborative activity that will require students to combine ideas. 

> **Instructor Note:** Students need their user interview data from the last class and their challenge to build affinity diagrams in this activity.

**Instructions**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**  If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms for groups of three to four as you describe the following activity. Follow these instructions to pre-assign breakout rooms for this and future activities.
>
> Pre build breakout rooms with groups of 3-4 people. Work with your TAs to create productive student groupings.

Use a Miro Board to combine affinity data via observations, user interviews, personas, etc.

- Groups should have all their ideas grouped, labeled, and with statements by the end of the activity:

> **Instructor Note:** Have all teams share their Miro board with you as you can open multiple tabs and watch groups before choosing which groups breakout room to help or assist during. Affinity diagramming is difficult work with your TAs to help keep students use Miro effectively.

- Establish groups and assign each a facilitator, a student who will create the Miro Board and invite their group members, TAs, and the instructor.

- Set a timer for 20 minutes:
  - Each group will create a Miro Board, and each team member will add data to the board.
- Set another timer for 20 minutes:
  - Teams will move on to Part 3 of the activity document to categorize sticky note data.
  - They will work together to categorize their data, look for similarities, and add their topic labels.

**Instructor and TAs**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**  You and the TAs should split up and visit the breakout rooms to monitor the teams' progress. Have each group add you and the TAs to their Miro Boards. This will give you "god" view as you can open multiple tabs or each groups affinity diagram. Jump into groups who seem behind are not adding sticky notes or who have started organizing too quickly.

> **Instructor Note:** Take screen shots of the groups you help and encourage groups to periodically capture the Affinity Diagramming process as it will move from busy to structure quickly.

A few things you want to observe:

- That affinity teams have started to combine sticky notes about 10 minutes into the activity.

- That students are breaking down large categories into smaller subsets.

- Students using one sticky note per idea.

If students struggle with defining categories too soon, they may be attempting it too soon. Suggest that students read through their group's sticky notes and add more ideas that are sparked or missing.

If students' note groupings don't make sense, suggest ungrouping the sticky notes and starting over, moving sticky notes to a new clean area on the Miro Board.

**Deliverable**

Students should post their completed affinity diagram in Slack.

## SLIDE 26
## 4. Instructor Do: Affinity Diagram Activity Review (15 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Close the breakout rooms, bring all students back to the main Zoom room, and lead a review of the activity.

- Be sure that students have shared a photo of or link to their affinity diagrams in Slack.

- Start by inviting students to volunteer to describe their affinity diagram to the class:

**Ask the presenters:**

- *Why did you sort the groups the way you did?*

- *What did you learn from doing this exercise?*

**Ask the whole class:**

- *Can a couple of you share one thing you like about their affinity diagram?*

- *What is one thing you would do differently?*

- *What is one thing you think can be improved?*

> **Instructor Note:** Reassure students, this is all new, and they will get better at affinity diagramming with practice. They are doing great!

Next, share some *actionable advice* that students can immediately apply to their work after class. For example:

- You can improve your affinity diagramming process by improving your initial user research. By asking open questions, gathering more interviews, and collecting more quantitative data via surveys, you can synthesize more data.

- Combining research allows your design team to uncover more patterns as well as visualize a lot of your work. Making research visual is a highly valuable skill and sharable across an organization.

- Capture images of the process as your affinity diagrams go through iterations; add these images to your portfolios and case studies.

Finally, close with some FAQs and common misconceptions about affinity diagraming that will help students avoid mistakes. For example:

- "Affinity diagrams are only for UX designers." False. The truth is pulling in multiple stakeholders can make visualizing research more collaborative.

- "Affinity diagrams are only useful at the beginning of the design process." False. The truth is user research is not "one and done."

> **Instructor Note:** ***Be encouraging:*** Before moving on, remind students that they will get better and better at affinity diagramming with practice. This is their first try—so, great work! Take any questions before moving on.


## SLIDE 27
Review

## SLIDE 28
- Ask, *"Have you ever seen someone with a **bad sunburn** and winced or shuddered in reaction to it?"*

- That wincing reaction is empathy.

**Empathy** is understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of another person.

**On empathy:**
Would you believe that we are wired for empathy? Scientific studies have found that when we observe another person’s action, pain, or affect, it can trigger parts of the *same neural networks* in our brains. It's as if we're experiencing the other person's feelings firsthand.

- Empathy is feeling "with" someone; sympathy is feeling "for" someone.

- Empathy fuels connection; sympathy drives disconnection.

*The four qualities of empathy:*
1. Gaining a perspective of others
2. Refraining from judgment
3. Recognizing emotions in others
4. Communicating the emotion of others

**Empathy Maps**

Empathy maps are a representation of multiple users, showing what their likes and dislikes are, and their pain points. Designers will present an empathy map to stakeholders to help them understand who is using their product.

1. **What it is:**

- Empathy maps are how design teams gain a deeper insight into their customers.
- They are a representation of multiple users, showing what their likes and dislikes are, as well as their pain points.
- Designers show empathy maps to stakeholders so they can understand who is using their product.

1. **When it is used:**

- Empathy maps are most useful at the beginning of the design process.
- After conducting interviews and user research to better understand user needs

1. **Why it matters:**

- We use empathy maps to refine our understanding of our users from research and interviews and to share our empathy findings
- To explore what the user is saying, thinking, feeling, and doing.
- To understand the user’s pain points from a product or feature.

**What a good empathy map achieves**:

- It provides a glance into who the user is as a whole and sheds light on problems to solve.

- It is quick to create and easy to iterate.

- It is a visualization tool design teams use to gain more profound insights into their users.


## SLIDES 32-37 (REVIEW WITH DETAILS BELOW)
A good empathy map provides a 360-degree view of empathy for the user, which communicates a user's different feelings and thinking states:

**Says:** This is what the user would say in his or her own words.
**Thinks:** This reflects the user's internal dialogue.
**Does:** This indicates how the user behaves (sometimes in conflict with what they say!).
**Feels:** This is the core empathy piece that reflects a user's actual feelings.
**Pain:** This describes the things that most frustrate a user.
**Gain:** This describes how the user benefits from the product in question.

Ask, *"When do you think is the best time to create an empathy map?*

- Empathy maps are most useful at the empathize phase of the design process. We try to build empathy maps after initial user research (like user interviews) before defining a problem or creating product requirements.

**How to Create an Empathy Map**

It's much easier to summon empathy for users when you have a helpful format. Like creating a list of pros and cons for decision-making, the format guides your thinking process.

The "basic" empathy map has four main sections and two "sub" sections:

- The four main sections are:
  - Says
  - Thinks
  - Does
  - Feels

- The two subsections are:
  - Pains
  - Gains

**First, complete the four main sections:**

By creating an empathy map, students/designers are methodically uncovering the user's needs. Encourage students to really do their best to step into the shoes of their user and try to imagine how their user feels based on the information gathered from their interviews.

- Write in each section or use sticky notes to complete the template.

- Your slides will do most of the "talking," but here are a few additional talking points. Remind students that the form will help them bring the user to life.

Ask, *"What order should you go in when completing the empathy map?"*

- Start by sketching a user or using a photo that represents the typical user.

- Fill in the four main sections before filling in the two subsections.

### Summary

In this activity, students will create another tool to synthesize user data while getting closer to the user and the problem they'll solve.

> **Instructor Note:** Students' affinity diagrams are their reference for this activity.

- Establish groups and assign each group a facilitator, a student who will create the Miro Board and invite their group members, TAs, and the instructor.

### Instructor and TAs

- Be on the lookout for the following:

- Are students filling in the empathy map sections in an order that makes sense? Says ► Thinks ► Feels ► Does. How to help:
  - Have student start with "says" and reference their interview scripts. "Says" content can be in direct quotes from your users.
- Are students getting stuck in a particular area? Students will struggle to distinguish between what a user does and what they say they do. For example, a user will say they work out five days a week. What they actually do is work out once a week. How to help:
  - When joining breakout rooms, make sure groups are referencing their affinity diagrams, interview data, and personas to combine together as a group.
  - Observations = does; says = "users quotes"; thinks = "what you think they think"; feels = observations of user's emotions.
- Is anyone struggling with statements that illustrate real empathy? Being authentic about the users is hard but will go a long way. How to help:

  - Like proto-personas, have your student use their own empathy for their defined user.

  - Have groups start by giving their user a first and last name and an age. Start calling that user by name in the discussion.

**Deliverable**

Students should share their empathy map Miro Boards on Slack.

## 7. Instructor Do: Empathy Map Activity Review (15 min)

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Close the breakout rooms, bring everyone back to the main Zoom room, and lead a review of the activity.

We want students to know the user much more intimately, have an appreciation for the power of an empathy map, and provide constructive criticism of students' work, which is this lesson's final learning objective. 

Ask students, *"What did you think about empathy maps—anyone care to share?"*

**Lead the class in a critique of two to four student examples.**

> **Instructor Note:** Be sure students have posted a share link to their Miro board or a screenshot in Slack.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**  Scroll through Slack and choose the first work sample.

- Open up the first work sample and share your screen.

- Invite student teams to speak about their work as you display it on your screen.

**Ask the presenters:**

*Why did you sort the groups the way you did?*

*What did you learn from doing this exercise?*

**Ask the whole class:**

*What is one thing you liked about this empathy map?*

*What is one thing you would do differently?*

*What is one thing you think can be improved?*

- Provide students with a few pieces of *actionable feedback* that they can apply directly to their work the next time they create an empathy map, for example:

  - Use direct quotes from your user for the "says" section.
  - Use color to identify emotions and connect emotions between think and feel (e.g., red = anger, green = happy, etc.).
- Finally, discuss any common misconceptions and FAQs about empathy maps. For example:
- "Empathy maps should be done all at once." False. The truth is, as you gather more research, your empathy maps should evolve as well. All design is iterative, so do not assume since you did it that your solution is correct.
- "Empathy maps are only used by UX designers." False. Any team member or client can benefit from understanding their users deeper---it just happens that UX designers have owned that role.

**Define user persona:** A user persona is a fictional character that designers create to represent the user. Why use user personas? It helps to have a person in mind to solve a problem for.

- User personas are a visual communication tool, too. They are formatted in one (or two) pages that can be quickly digested by the client and your design teammates.

- User personas contain information: their name, appearance, and location, but a brief description of their preferences and behaviors.
  - You can think of a user persona as a mini-biography or ID card for your user!

Ask, **"Can anyone remind us of the difference between a proto-persona and a user persona??"** (***Hint!*** This was discussed at the beginning of class!)

Proto-personas vs. user personas:
- Proto-personas are based on a hypothesis—your best guess. They are created *before* user research.
- User personas are based on data, facts, and information gathered. They are done *after* user research.  
- Just like empathy maps, user personas allow you to get to know the user and *quickly* communicate who they are. As UX designers, we use multiple tools to visualize and share the importance of user-centered design. Empathy for your users is one of the primary skills you will bring to a company as a UX designer.

What's the purpose of personas, you might wonder? It is to create realistic representations of your key user segments.

- They are based on mainly quantitative user research (facts and data) and some qualitative information (exploratory).
- They are a quick and inexpensive way to test and prioritize features throughout the development process.

**1. What User Personas Are:**

- The purpose of user personas is to create realistic representations of your key user segments.
- Based on qualitative and some quantitative user research and web analytics.
- Quick and inexpensive way to test and prioritize features throughout the development process.

**2. When User Personas Are Used:**

- User personas are most useful at the beginning of the design process.

**3. Why User Personas Matter:**

- We use user personas to share empathy and distribute our initial user research to teams.
- Allow stakeholders and leaders to evaluate new app feature ideas.
- Help designers create the overall look and feel of the website.
- Help copywriters ensure site content is written to the appropriate audiences.

**User Personas' Benefits**

- Allow stakeholders an opportunity to evaluate new app feature ideas.

- Help designers create the overall look and feel of the website.

- Show copywriters the appropriate audience they should be writing site content for.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:**  As a UX/UI designer, you will work on or use different user personas. It is incumbent on you to have multiple high-quality user personas as part of your UX/UI portfolio. You will be expected to have these. Include this skill as part of your resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

**How to Build a User Persona**

A well-defined user persona contains three key pieces of information:
- Header:
  - The header includes a fictional name, image, and quote that summarizes what matters most to the persona as it relates to your product.
- Demographic profile:
  - While the name and image can be fictional, demographic details are factual and based on user research.
  - Example: A user is not an age range (e.g., the user is 25 years old, not ages 25-35).
- End goal:
  - This is the motivating factor that inspires action (e.g., wants to lose 15 pounds).

## SLIDE 49
**User Persona Template**

As a whole, the user persona should talk through the six sections of the User Persona Template.

1. **User name:** Use a photo of a REAL person. Include a slogan or quote that represents their personality in relation to the product.

   - For example: *"Traveling alone allows for deeper experiences."*

2. **Basic demographics:** age, location, job, family, etc.

3. **Personality:** introvert, extrovert, etc.

4. **Goal:** What's important to them?

   - For example: *Finding restaurants off the beaten path.*

5. **Frustrations:** Challenges that keep them from working on their goals.

6. **Bio:** A description of the target user and the user journey.

   - For example: *Jill is a regional director who travels four to eight times each month for work. She has a specific region in which she travels, and she often visits the same cities and stays at the same hotels. She is frustrated by the fact that no matter how frequently she takes similar trips, she spends hours of her day booking travel. She expects her travel solutions to be as organized as she is.*

7. **Motivation:** These are the things that make them do what they do.

   - For example: *personal growth, adventure, bragging rights, bucket list, etc.*

8. **Preferred channels:** This describes how the user prefers to hear about travel apps—advertising.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share why these six sections play an important role in your work with clients, and which ones are especially compelling.

## 10. Student Do: User Personas Activity (20 min)

:watch: 20 minutes :busts_in_silhouette: Groups of 3-4 :pencil2: Miro

**:information_source: TAs please Slack out** to students the following links:** 

- [01-Week/02-Activities/01.3/01.3-01-User Persona Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxWy9-VLvYP05ytq-MpxBRLnengpuFdfP6X2pAQnSuk/edit?usp=sharing).

- [Figma Tempalate-Proto-Persona-into User-Persona](https://www.figma.com/file/9F3cobqII9LJiKcIry4ubr/01.3-03-Proto-Persona-into-User-Persona-Template)

**Summary**

In this activity, students will use their affinity diagram to create a user persona.

Students are learning how to synthesize data and communicate about the user creatively and concisely—applying methods all designers use.

**Instructions**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms for groups of three to four as you describe the following activity. Follow these instructions to pre-assign breakout rooms for this and future activities. 

- Broadcast a two-minute warning to breakout rooms to help them wrap up this activity.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**  Place groups in the same breakout rooms for the groups of 3-4 students in Zoom.


- Assign a student facilitator to create the collaborative Figma file and share with the group.

- Share the Figma resource.
  - Have students make a copy and share the Figma file with the instructor and TAs.

- Set a timer for 20 minutes.

**Instructor and TAs**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**  Keep 1 group in the main room to preserve the class recording. Visit the breakout rooms with your TAs to support students as they work. What to look out for:

- Are students taking too much time sketching out their template? How to help:
  - Each member can find an image and they can quickly vote on which works best.
- Remind students that all the information they need should come from their affinity diagrams and empathy maps.
- Tell them not to worry too much if they stray a bit from the template regarding naming their categories to describe their users.
- Periodically capture screenshots to record the user persona process.
- Give your students a two-minute warning before the activity is completed. Use the @channel in Slack.


## SLIDE 54
## 11. Instructor Do: User Persona Activity Review (15 min)

:globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**  Close breakout rooms and bring everyone back to the main Zoom room to discuss the activity.

**Say:** "I hope you can see how important this tool is for empathizing with your users and truly understanding where they're coming from."

**Ask:** Does anyone want to share an observation about this tool?"

**Invite two to four students to present their work.**

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**  Scroll through the work shared in Slack and choose the first example to discuss.

For each group whose work you select, have them present their work:

- Have each group summarize their user persona—then shift to the questions below.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:**  The groups can elect a representative or take turns speaking about their user persona as a team.

**Questions for presenters:**

*What's one thing you like and one thing you'd do differently about your user persona?*

**Ask a TA:**

- *What is one thing you like about this persona?*

- *What is one thing you would do differently?*

> **Ask:**

- *What is one thing you like about this user persona?*

- *What is one thing you would do differently?*

Next, select another group's work and invite them to present their work.

Repeat the process as time permits.

> Finally, take questions to be sure everyone is comfortable with the user persona concept.

## 12. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (2 min)

***You did it!*** You have practiced creating UX deliverables that will help you get a job and are worthy of putting in your design portfolio.

First, help students reinforce their learning with a recall exercise.

:globe_with_meridians: **Online recommendation:** Instead of switching to Zoom gallery view, have students share their answers in the Zoom chat or Slack so they can refer to your shared screen to answer this question.: 


- What are some features of an affinity diagram?
  - *Acceptable answers: Combining research together to reveal patterns and opportunities from the user research.*
- What does an empathy map include?
  - *Acceptable answers: What a user says, thinks, does, and feels.*
- Why do designers use empathy maps?
  - *Acceptable answers: To build authentic models of their users.*
- What part of the design thinking process do these concepts belong to?
  - *Answer: The define phase.*

Now, take a moment to see if there are any questions about any of the concepts covered in today's lesson.

> **Instructor Note:** Remind students that you are available for Office Hours for 30 minutes after class.

Wish everyone a good night.
