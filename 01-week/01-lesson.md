# 1.1 Lesson Plan: Introduction to UX and Design Thinking

---

## Overview

In today's lesson, students will introduce themselves and get to know the class structure and course topics. You'll give an overview of user experience (UX) and design thinking, define UX, describe the design thinking process, and explain how designers apply it in their work. Toward the end of class, students will practice with a simulation of the design process to prepare for their homework or "challenge." Have fun with this task!

***Unit 1, in a nutshell***: Today's lesson is about understanding the methods of user research and practicing the Five Whys interview technique. The next two lessons (1.2 and 1.3) will deal with the fundamental skills of user research, which students will reinforce with in-class activities, as well as research synthesis and affinity diagrams.

***In-class activities***: All in-class activities are additive, with each activity building on the previous one—throughout this lesson as well as the boot camp itself. What's more, the in-class activities will prepare students to tackle their challenge, which requires them to complete most of the heavy-lifting at home.

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Please review the UX/UI Boot Camp’s [Welcome Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mivo--iy7mJfW5XWxqDuW6S74rLdMEoxvmWyYTij26g/edit?usp=sharing) and [Weekly Syllabus](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aAOEE_Cmy4TiUblnx7r3Yyx1NSxRInAGa9qLFQI4lfM) to familiarize yourself with the course outline.
>
> - There’s also a [student-facing syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TX-ev7X14ilYsOLeFlKVlkBrjYgW9JPkvjeUehiFEkI/edit), which your teaching assistants (TAs) will Slack out later today.

***The next four weeks:*** Lesson 1.1 kicks off a four-week series (Units 1-4) covering various aspects of the UX design process. During weeks 5-7, students will design a mobile app, a project that will empower them to master the fundamentals of the design thinking process.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today’s class, students will be able to:

1. Establish positive, collaborative relationships with other students, the instructor, and the TAs.

2. Define what UX means and provide at least one real-life example of UX.

3. Summarize the overarching course narrative and high-level goals.

4. Define the five stages of the design thinking process (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test).

5. Collaborate and develop a proto-persona via group brainstorming sessions to articulate user demographics, needs, goals, and pain points.

---

### Class at a Glance

- Make students feel comfortable by conveying that you and the TAs are *committed to their success*.
- In the first half of class, students will receive an overview of the course, an introduction to UX and design thinking.
- In the second half of class, students will be introduced to the empathize phase of the design thinking process. As a class, you'll make a proto-persona and will practice informal user interviews using the Five Whys Method.
- You'll give one demo today (Miro, Section 13), so be sure to do an advance run-through.

> **Instructor Note:** During the Software Check Activity, you'll gather students' Figma emails using a **copy** of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1q5tdDgnszZ71dXONpOWFQ0hx9_XbSutCFFcxtuAmU/edit?usp=sharing).

- Empower your TA to help you stay on track. If you're like most instructors, you'll talk until the clock runs out.

- Use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found here: [Chrome Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).


### Instructor Notes

Many of our activities were written for in-person classes, so we've added in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: > :globe_with_meridians:) to let you know how to adapt an activity for online delivery.

Remember, you can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab. Practice your transitions to and from the slideshow.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Narrating what you're doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
- From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view: “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”
- From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser: “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

### Preparing for Class

**Welcome and thank you for being part of our program.**

- With the work of instructors and TAs like yourselves, we’re helping thousands of students achieve their goals and creative dreams. Over the next 24 weeks, you’ll take students on a UX/UI adventure and alter the course of their lives. There’s a long journey ahead, giving you plenty of time to make an impact. So buckle up! You’re in for a fun ride.

**Make students feel comfortable. Connect and build trust.**

- Today’s class is all about making students feel comfortable. This means showing them from the get-go that you and the TAs are committed to their success. Many of your students will have jitters on the first day, so do what you can to keep them engaged. Make sure they know that you will support them through any struggles ahead.

**Overpower first-day nervousness.**

- Because students might be anxious, it’s very important that you're prepared for today’s class. Practice aloud at home and think through the details of your presentation and transitions. On the first day, students will be extra-perceptive to your hesitations, and any lack of preparation will show. That said, don’t regurgitate your entire lesson from memory; inject your personal style and industry know-how when appropriate.

- The first class provides an opportunity to make students feel comfortable with one another. Many students will enter class unsure of what to expect. They may recall classes filled with dull lectures and high-stakes exams. It’s important to convey that this class will be far more collaborative and project-based. As an instructor, one of your objectives is to ensure that every class feels like a vibrant community of learning.

- Today's class is filled with activities and group discussions for students to dive into design thinking. Do your part as an instructor and TAs to ensure these group activities put students at ease and facilitate meaningful conversations. Circulate among the students, ask probing questions, and keep the environment lighthearted.

- Read aloud all activity instructions. It’s easier for students to dive into activities when you provide clear verbal guidance and summarize the key steps.

**Review the slides beforehand.**

- [01-Week/01-Slides/01.1-Introduction to Design Thinking + UX Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16iSmSibQD73RXO670nIdUWRWi39cD_tF_gAEak8QHe0/edit?usp=sharing)

- Make any teaching notes you'll need. Feel free to modify the slides with your own examples and style, but be sure to cover the stipulated activities.

- As you lecture, relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future goals.

- Look for the :gem: icon, which prompts you and/or a TA to share professional anecdotes directly related to a particular concept.

**Manage the Class Google Drive.**

- At the beginning of each unit, manage the Class Google Drive by following this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QzOkLG_dbrxTRbcfc0AOB7QhdZnuxjvuKlc8rHc5QZc/edit). Be sure to move content from the Trilogy-UX/UI Instructor Curriculum Drive to your Class Google Drive. If you need access to your Class Google Drive, contact your Student Support Manager (SSM).

**Take time for introductions.**

- Lastly, realize that while introductions might take a long time, they are essential to establishing a positive group dynamic. Feel free to adjust today’s lesson plan by cutting down or skipping the critique activity if time is running short.

**Review the How to Use Miro slide deck.**

- Online classes will use Miro.com — a remote collaboration whiteboarding tool. Please review the [How to Use Miro slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gfg3UOpkayttek7dUcxFDVb4HRw3uvHHQxR7KY8h0eI/edit?usp=sharing).

### Class Materials

Coordinate with the Cohort SSM for help providing some classroom materials, such as the following:

- Computers, cameras, or smartphones for recording


### Strategies for Class Online

- The original class materials were not designed for an online class, so there might be some gaps in the instructional materials and the student experience.

  - The curriculum team will be updating activities and engagement strategies over time.
  - Look for the > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation** icon throughout this lesson plan for tips on adapting lessons for online teaching.

### Online Classes

Online classes require more effort in creating collaboration than in a traditional classroom space. Encourage your students to build a collaborative and engaging learning environment.

### Online Activities

We want to ensure all students work in pairs on activities to avoid isolation. Utilize breakout rooms in Zoom for these situations.

### Online Peer Review

Peer review is built into the curriculum as a way for students to practice giving constructive feedback in the classroom. This element will be difficult to mirror online. Be flexible and try a few approaches to find one that works for you:

1. Use review time to extend the activity time for students.
2. Let students try peer review and see how it goes. Adjust accordingly.
3. Add more time for reviews at the end of the activity.

### Online Teaching Strategies

1. Prebuild and assign Zoom breakout rooms to your TAs to speed up getting into and out of activities.

2. Shorten or combine review times to allow more time for the students on the activities.

3. During reviews, have everyone share their screen. As the instructor, you can then move between students at random, quickly holding everyone accountable and focused during reviews.

   - [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000424286-Sharing-Multiple-Screens-Simultaneously](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000424286-Sharing-Multiple-Screens-Simultaneously)

4. Assign an activity "Student Lead" for each student breakout group.

   - This means that one student should create, share, and invite fellow activity members to their collaboration document, whether it be a Google Doc, Miro board, InVision Freehand, Figma Artboard, etc. based on the activity needs.

5. Disable the Zoom chat and focus all communications through Slack.

   - [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207442843-Disable-Notifications-From-Group-Chat-Mobile-](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207442843-Disable-Notifications-From-Group-Chat-Mobile-)

6. Shorten lecture times as much as possible to maximize activity interaction and production time. Consider combining the lecture sections at the beginning of class and using the rest of the time for activities and reviews. 

7. Get creative with office hours.

   - To maximize your time, schedule 10- to 15-minute review blocks for you and the TAs to check in with each student.
   - Use a Slack poll to query your students for topic reviews, tool demos, etc.

## 1. University Do: University and Student Success Team Introductions (60 min)

During this hour, the University and Student Success Team will introduce themselves and talk with your class.

**Tips:**

- Do your best to relax during this time. Observe students.
- Do a time check at the 30-minute mark to ensure the University and Student Success Team is managing its time wisely.
- If introductions slightly exceed an hour, don't worry; today's lesson is designed so that you will be able to fit everything in.
  - Give just a brief bio today, and expand on it during Day 2.
  - Save time by extending office hours—let students know you are happy to stay online as long as needed.
- Once it's your turn, take charge of the class once the University and Success Team leaves—this is *your class*.

## 2. Instructor Do: Introductions (10 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Only do this if you have not yet introduced yourself and your TAs. Your goal is for students to get comfortable with one another as a class and for you to set a productive tone for the next 24 weeks. This lecture supports today's first learning objective, which is for students to establish positive, collaborative relationships with other students, the instructor, and the TAs.

Begin the slideshow: [01-Week/01-Slides/01.1-Introduction to Design thinking + UX Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16iSmSibQD73RXO670nIdUWRWi39cD_tF_gAEak8QHe0/edit?usp=sharing).

**TAs:** Share a PDF of the slides on the Class Google Drive.

***Introductions.***

Ask your TAs to introduce themselves to the class and to discuss their current roles and how they started working in UX design.

Next, ask the students to take turns introducing themselves and share what motivated them to sign up for this course.

Next, Take a couple of minutes to introduce yourself. Discuss your current role and responsibilities, and share your bio and professional background if you choose.

Be sure to tell your students why you love design. Knowing this will excite them and help them connect with you.

Finally, review today's learning objectives.


## SLIDES 1-4 Review

## SLIDE 5

UX (user experience) design is a process used by design teams to create products that provide useful experiences to users. This includes aspects of branding, design, usability, and function.

- “UX” comprises of all aspects of a person’s interaction with a company, its services, and the products. In UX (and the tech world in general), we refer to people as “users,” hence the term “user experience.”

## SLIDE 6
**UX designers think about the why, what, and how.**

UX professionals should consider the why, what, and how of using a product.

- *Why* is about the users’ motivations. Can users relate to a task or values?

- *What* is about the product's functionality. What can users do with the product?

- *How* is about the design of functionality in an accessible and creative way.


## SLIDE 7
**UX is not UI design.**

UX designers are typically seen as interface or visual designers. That is a poor understanding.

- A UX designer is concerned with the entirety of a product: branding, design, usability, and functionality.

## SLIDE 8
**UX design is human-centered.**

Whatever you design, think of the people who’ll use your website, product, or service. Those people are not abstract "users." They are real human beings who will interact with your product. Keep in mind that your product is just a tool that helps them reach their goal.

## SLIDE 9
**Good UX is good for business.**

- According to a Forrester Research study, companies that invest in UX see a lower cost of customer acquisition, lower support cost, increased customer retention, and increased market share.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** As a UX designer, you will be expected to drive the business's return on investment (ROI). Your ability to collaborate and communicate with business types will improve your job opportunities. Add UX business acumen to your resume and LinkedIn skill profile.

## SLIDE 11
Review

## SLIDE 12
**Design is a team sport.**

Luckily, the stereotype of the “rockstar designer” is going away. As teams and products grow in complexity, designers are valued because of their collaboration and team-building skills, rather than individual tasks.

Today, being an designer means bringing the team together, checking all egos at the door, and helping to create a safe space for collaboration.

## SLIDE 13
_Review quote from David Kim_

## SLIDE 14
**There are many roles on UX teams.**

The UX field is vast, and many specializations occur in the field. During this boot camp, students should try to identify their passions. Share your experience working with the different roles we encounter in the UX field.

## SLIDE 15
**Emotional intelligence is a must-have skill for designers.**

UX is about examining and coordinating business needs, user needs, and resources to get the best possible solution. To do well in UX, we need to empathize with everyone involved. A UX designer needs to be fluent in everything from business to technology to design, yet be an advocate for users.

- Emotional intelligence (aka emotional quotient, or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges, and defuse conflict.

**information_source: TAs please Slack out** [Why a UX Designer Needs High Emotional Intelligence](https://medium.com/@asukakondo/why-ux-designer-needs-high-emotional-intelligence-bdba0135a9f8).

## SLIDES 16-17
Review

## SLIDE 18
Throughout this boot camp, you will gain a number of skills, including:

- Design thinking, UX, and human-centered design research methods
- User research
- Interaction design
- Information architecture
- UI design
- Visual design
- UI branding
- Front-end web design
- Responsive web design (RWD)

You will learn the necessary hard skills to be effective UX/UI designers. However, your biggest challenge will be developing the critical soft skills of design, including but not limited to:

- Communication and critique
- Collaboration
- Flexibility

**information_source: TAs please Slack out**  the UX/UI Boot Camp Course Syllabus to the students: [UX/UI Boot Camp Course Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TX-ev7X14ilYsOLeFlKVlkBrjYgW9JPkvjeUehiFEkI/edit?usp=sharing).

## SLIDE 19
- The next six months will be hard work!

- Growth can be painful, but we’re here to support and help you. Ultimately, you will get out of this course what they put into it.

- Realistically, you will need to work **15 to 20 hours** outside of class each week.

- The hardest part about boot camp for students is time management. Most work full time while taking this course, so in all, they’ll be carrying a high workload. **Anyone who works more than 40 hours per week for an extended time is at risk of burnout.** Be diligent about their time and remind them they have committed to this boot camp for six months. ALSO - ASK QUESTIONS! The students who really apply themselves, take time outside of class to study and grow as well as ask a lot of questions nearly always get the jobs first. 

## SLIDE 20
- Optimism is the key. After 15 years of study, Harvard Business School discovered the key to success: optimism. The stress of career change plus work and family life can make us feel depressed, anxious, or even helpless. By adopting a positive mental attitude, we’ll see failures as mere steppingstones on the path to success.

## SLIDE 21
Questions??


> **Say, “Raise your hand if you want a new job!**”

- Let students know that before they can get a new job, *the UX/UI Boot Camp will be their new job.*

- Students should expect a lot from themselves—this is called boot camp for a reason.

- Remind them that you’ll be with them every step of the way and that they're not doing this alone.

- Tell them that you were a beginner once, just like they are now. Tell them that deep learning takes time and dedication, but that they can do it. They were selected for this program because we know they have what it takes.

## SLIDE 22
## 6. Student Do: Software Check Activity (5 min)

**TAs,** send the following to students on Slack:

- Software Check [01-Week/02-Activities/01.1/01.1-00-Software Check Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CrvAIK1M8gWb5epC15MvL0ChYrJ0QQgYnRXAQHbNBUA/edit?usp=sharing) to students on Slack.

- The [Software Resource Links](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cZFyb_bqD9_rgaJ_P45zPfdCCydSmi8NDfjOePYb_TU/edit?usp=sharing) for students to review at home. 

**Summary**

In this activity, students will confirm that their software tools—Figma, Miro, InVision, and Google Drive—are installed and up to date.

**Instructions**

Students should share their screens and install or test their software tools:

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Have every student share their screen and show their software is installed. Talk with students or use the chat feature, whichever works best for the situation. TAs jump in and help any students who are behind. Use the remote control feature in Zoom to clear up any technical snags. [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control)

*Students who already have the tools installed:* Encourage students to go deeper and practice using the tools.

**Instructor and TAs,** watch the student screens and help students who are struggling by walking them through installing the software.

*For students who struggle:* Struggling students can use the hand-raised feature in Zoom to show they need assistance.

**Deliverable**

At the end of this activity, all students will have installed the tools and entered their email in the Figma Email Sign Up Form. > :globe_with_meridians: Ask students to post "all set!" or a thumbs-up emoji in Slack once they have verified that each tool is installed.

**You will build employer-competitive design portfolios that will help you jobs.** However - you won't always have time to really perfect these - many students go back at the end of class and polish later. Getting the core concepts down is more important. **Perfect is the enemy of good**

## SLIDES 28
In-class activities, the six big projects, and the weekly Challenge assignments are all designed to help you build a UX/UI design portfolio. As a UX designer, your portfolio will be the most valuable asset you have in your job hunt. Companies today will not consider you without a professional portfolio.

Review

## SLIDE 32
Review slide and then touch on Zoom etiquette - 
  **Best Practice 1. Always mute your mic.**
    - If you're not speaking, put yourself on mute.
  **Best Practice 2: Use your first and last name for the screen username.**
    - Help everyone get to know you by including your name.
  **Best Practice 3: Keep your video on.**
    - Be present during the online class—this includes showing your face.
  **Best Practice 4: Raise your hand in Zoom or use Slack.**
    - Don't interrupt a lecture; use the raise hands feature in Zoom or ask the question via Slack.
    - Remind students that you and the TA will circle back to answer questions.
  **Best Practice 5: Use headphones with a mic.**
    - Background noise and feedback echoes can be an issue with using your computer mic and speakers. Use headphones with a microphone to improve sound quality and clarity when speaking.

## SLIDE 33
**UX tools matter less than you think.**
- It's more important for UX designers to know what they want to achieve than which tool they will use to do it.

UX design is all about your design knowledge and how you apply it to create meaningful results—and not so much about which tool you use to apply that knowledge.

**Design Thinking Overview**

1. What it is:

    - Design thinking is a five-step problem-solving process. It is iterative, flexible, and focused on collaboration between designers and users.

2. When it is used:

    - The process is used in every project. Each project can differ greatly, depending on the timelines, budgets, goals, team personalities, and even the work styles of clients and stakeholders (often very hands-on). Therefore, the process requires constant tailoring for each project. Being able to customize your process requires confidence that only comes from experience and practice.

3. Why it matters:

      - To create designs that are relevant to your users
      - To create designs that are easy and enjoyable to use
      - To understand the return on investment of your UX design

## SLIDES 37-39
**Design thinking has five steps.**

- **Empathize** by talking with your users.

- **Define** your user’s problems in a way that can be solved.

- **Ideate** by brainstorming ideas for innovative solutions.

- **Prototype** by building prototypes for the proposed solution.

- **Test** your prototypes until a viable product or service is created.


## SLIDE 40
UX designers should always build products on the foundation of user research, following the stages of the design thinking process:

1. Empathize:

   - Designers learn about their users.
   - The key is to feel what users feel—their pains and frustrations.
   - Designers aren’t users—they have to get to know users objectively.

## SLIDE 41
2. Define:

   - Designers will often use a problem statement to frame a user’s problem and provide context.
   - For example, a user needs a mobile app to order a cab and conduct a background check to vet the driver.
   - Framing problems is essential so that we can create useful solutions and explore opportunities.

## SLIDE 42
3. Ideate:

   - Think "ideas" when you think of the ideation stage.
   - Designers use brainstorming to generate ideas and solutions.
   - The output of this phase are ideas that can be prototyped.

## SLIDE 43
4. Prototype:

   - This stage brings possible solutions into sharper focus.
   - Different methods are involved, such as sketching and prototyping.
   - The main goal is to create rough drafts of solutions to determine if they will help solve the problem.

## SLIDE 44
5. Test:

   - Testing is the final stage of designing a solution.
   - Testing is *iterative*, so it involves testing, adjusting, and testing again.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** The design thinking process is absolutely necessary for every project professionals work on. The process sets clear expectations, puts clients at ease, and decreases the risk of failure. Add design thinking to your resume and LinkedIn skills profile.

**Case Study: Using Design Thinking to Disrupt Medicine**

The design thinking process yields great products. To illustrate, share the PillPack case study:

- PillPack is an online pharmacy that began as a startup-in-residence at IDEO Cambridge. Working with designers and using a human-centered approach, PillPack refined its brand vision, strategy, and identity across channels. Encourage students to read the [case study](https://www.ideo.com/case-study/this-startup-revolutionized-an-industry-through-design) describing how PillPack did it. By all accounts, the initiative was successful. *Time magazine* named PillPack one of the best inventions of 2014, and Amazon bought PillPack for $1 billion in 2018.

## SLIDE 49
Research is the first step in the UX design process. Without it, our work can only be based on our own experiences and assumptions, which are not objective.

- Design research underpins and supports the entire design thinking process. Design research applies qualitative and quantitative metrics and takeaways to problem solving. It fully leverages the empathize phase and incorporates user feedback.

**User Research Overview**

1. What it is:

    - All user research has in common is that it helps place people at the center of your design process and products.

    - User research is about understanding users, who will always provide insights.

    - User research uses qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, contextual inquiries, diary studies, personas, card sorting, and usability testing.

    - Designing for users means learning everything we can about them  and iteratively testing our work with them throughout the design process.

2. When it is used:

    - Test designs to validate an iteration

    - Build a new feature

    - Understand who is the user

    - Conduct user interviews

3. Why it matters:

    - To create designs that are truly relevant to your users

    - To create designs that are easy and pleasurable to use

    - To understand the ROI of your UX design

## SLIDE 50
**User researchers own the empathize phase.**

- UX researchers gather insights into users’ needs.

- A dedicated researcher minimizes guesswork or groundless assumptions.

- You'll work with designers, product managers, developers, and engineers to create an experience that connects with their audience.

## SLIDE 51
Erin Sanders at Frog Design created the research learning spiral. The first two steps entail forming questions and establishing a hypothesis. The last three steps entail gathering knowledge through selected UX research methods.

1. **Objectives:** Determine the knowledge gaps we need to fill.

2. **Hypothesis:** Determine what we think we understand about our users.

3. **Methods:** Based on time and workforce, select the appropriate methods.

4. **Conduct:** Collect data through the defined methods.

5. **Synthesis:** Fill in the knowledge gaps, prove or disprove the hypotheses, and discover opportunities for the design efforts.

**Proto-Persona Overview**

1. What it is:

    - A persona (also user persona, customer persona, buyer persona, or proto-persona) in user-centered design is a fictional character created to represent a user type.

    - Proto-personas are an ad hoc, non-research-backed articulation of a customer archetype. Proto-personas are used as a starting point. It is the role of the researchers to validate or invalidate the proto-persona.

2. When it is used:

    - Proto-personas are great for kicking off a project meeting when the goal is to identify all of the possible personas to target.

    - Proto-personas provide small companies and startups a faster alternative to more traditional methods. Still, they provide you with a helpful base of information about your hypothetical users.

3. Why it matters:

    - Proto-personas are used to get alignment among stakeholders and executives.

    - Proto-personas provide small companies and startups a faster alternative to more traditional methods.

## SLIDE 56
**There are four steps for creating a proto-persona:**

1. Humanize your user with a name, age, and stick-figure drawing.

## SLIDE 57
2. Define the demographics (e.g., family status, income, location, devices owned, personality traits, etc.).

## SLIDE 58
3. Add user needs and goals by answering:

    - What is your user trying to accomplish?
    - Why does your user need to do this?
    - How important are these needs or goals?

## SLIDE 59
4. Define the pain points by answering:

    - What is your user not able to accomplish?
    - When does your user get frustrated?
    - How is your user feeling?

## SLIDE 60
5. Review & Iterate your proto-persona

    - Add a key (user needs, user goals, pain points, frustrations, solutions)
    - How authentic is your user?
    - Clean up/remove stereotypes
    - Share with your team

To summarize, user research is a designer's bridge to the user's needs and desires. Proto-personas bring users to life. Students will build countless proto-personas during their career, as well as in this boot camp. Next, the students will practice.

> :briefcase: **Employer Competitive Note:** Proto-personas involve common tools and activities that designers are expected to use with everyday clients. Add this skill to your resume and your LinkedIn skills profile, and make sure you include these initial empathy deliverables in your portfolio case studies.

## 13. Instructor Do: Demo - Miro (8 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to show students around Miro's interface, which you will use during the subsequent activity as you and the class develop a proto-persona together.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Navigate away from the slideshow for this demonstration. If you shared your entire desktop, make sure to open your files on that shared desktop. If you shared a single window, be sure to re-share your screen to capture the appropriate window or desktop.
Remember to narrate what you are doing during transitions and demonstrations. For example, you might say: “I’m now going to switch from the slideshow to another tab so I can demonstrate.”

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** Since you’ll be sharing your screen for this demonstration, ask students to use the raise hands feature on Zoom to ask questions. At a good breaking point, call on a specific student to unmute and ask their question. Alternatively, you can ask students to share their questions in the Zoom chat and have the TA provide answers in the chat.

> :key: **Key Tech Note:** The free version of Miro only allows three boards to be active at a time. Students and instructional staff do not have to purchase purchase a Miro license to complete or be successful in the bootcamp. To overcome the board limit, we recommend that you maximize the amount of space used on a board and take frequent screenshots of your boards to save your work.

> **Instructor Note:** Be logged into your accounts before class starts as to avoid forgetting a password or any other processes that can eat up time.

Before we create a proto-persona, let's review a tool we'll use today: Miro, a free digital collaboration tool for designers and product managers.

- Review the [How to Use Miro slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gfg3UOpkayttek7dUcxFDVb4HRw3uvHHQxR7KY8h0eI/edit?usp=sharing).

- Review these slides before class so that you're prepared to demo Miro. Please keep the demonstration to 8 minutes max.

**Instructions**:

1. Go to [Miro.com](https://miro.com/).
   - Create an account (login if you already have one).
   - To create an account, click GET STARTED.

2. Create a board:

   - Miro has templates! But we’ll use a blank board.

   - Click BLANK BOARD.

**Summary**

This is an instructor-led activity. You will be guiding the students through the creation of a proto-persona as a big group using the Miro collaboration whiteboard design tool.

> **Instructor Note:** Likely, most students have not used Miro or a digital whiteboard collaboration tool. Be patient and let them know they'll be experimenting, and it'll haphazard, but design is messy and fun, so buckle up!

**Instructions**

 > :globe_with_meridians: **Online Recommendation:** When leading activities in Zoom, Open the Miro board and share your screen. Flip between the activity document and the Miro board to talk through the activity actions you're taking on the screen. Have students follow along.

1. Follow the instructions in the activity document. Read them out loud to your class.
2. Share a link to your Miro board and team with your class in Slack.
3. Share your Miro screen in Zoom so all students are in your Miro board.
4. Walk through the rest of the activity moving through each quadrant of the proto-persona as a class.

**For each quadrant of the proto-persona, see the group instructions below.**

> **Instructor Note:** Spend about five minutes per proto-persona quadrant. Use a timer to help keep pace.

1. Who is our user?
   - Direct students:
       - Have everyone use a sticky note in Miro in light blue. 
       - Ask, **"Who do you think is a typical Airbnb user?"** 
       - Have students place their sticky notes to the side of the proto-persona canvas.
       - Have them add their names on their sticky notes, small and in the corner, to help the instructor and TAs on Day 1.

   - **Instructor and TAs:** While students are adding their sticky notes to Miro, you and your TAs can start reorganizing the notes into patterns by age.

   - Choose a user from a big grouping of sticky notes, and graduate that user as the sample for the class to build out!

   - Ask, **"Who added this user? Why?"**

   - **TA,** using the draw/pencil tool, draw your chosen user.

2. Move to Behavior Demographics.

   - Repeat the process with yellow sticky notes in Miro.

   - **Instructor and TAs:** While students are adding their sticky notes to Miro, you and your TAs can start reorganizing them into patterns by moving the behavior demographics to the appropriate quadrant.

3. Move to Goals and Needs.

   - Repeat the process with light green (for goals) and green (for needs) sticky notes in Miro.

   - **Instructor and TAs:** While students are adding their sticky notes to Miro, you and your TAs can start reorganizing them into patterns by moving the needs and behaviors to the appropriate quadrant.

4. Move to Pain-points and Potential Solutions.

   - Repeat the process with pink (for pain-points) and light grey (potential solutions) sticky notes in Miro.

   - **Instructor and TAs:** While students are adding their sticky notes to Miro, you and your TAs can start reorganizing them into patterns by moving the pain-points and potential solutions to the final quadrant.

**Instructor and TAs**

Instructors serve as the conductor sharing the activity instructions and modeling the behavior in Miro before inviting your students to join in.

> **Instructor Note:** Encourage spacial organization and placing the proto-persona canvas in the middle of the Miro board and students adding a sticky note to the outside that will get moved from outside to inside.

TAs jump into the Miro board with the class and act as participants and organizers moving students' Miro sticky notes into groups and patterns.

- If a student is struggling to get into Miro, help troubleshoot in Slack.

- **TAs,** make screenshots periodically through out the activity to capture the Miro process.

## 15. Instructor Do: Proto-Personas Activity Review (5 min)

Bring attention back to your screen and prepare to lead students in a review of the activity that will help them think more deeply about how proto-personas characterize a user and help to build group consensus.

> :globe_with_meridians: Ask students to raise their hands in front of their screens or use Zoom's raise hands feature to volunteer to answer questions. They can then share their screens when they speak.

Ask students the following:

- Who would like to share what they learned first?
- Why do you think it's important we learn how to ask why?

Invite the TAs to provide feedback as well.

Finally, share a few common misconceptions or FAQs about proto-personas with the class. For example:

- Proto-personas are a hypothesis. They are a starting point, and the designers' job is to validate the assumptions made.
- True personas are developed from research with clearly defined objectives.

> **Instructor Note:** Take any questions students may have before moving on to user interviews.

**User Interviews Overview**

1. What it is:

    - User interviews are a UX research method that provides insight into what users think about product or process. They help identify what users perceive as important on the site or what users think would make for an improved product.

    - They are a quick and easy way to collect user data. They are often used in lean and agile environments.

2. When it is used:

    - At any point in the design process (to help inform user personas, journey maps, and ideas for site features or workflow).

    - During a field study, it can be used to strengthen the study, with a breakdown of tools and processes, as well as how they are perceived by users.

    - At the end of a usability test, to collect responses related to observed behaviors.

3. Why it matters:

    - Interviews provide insight into what users think about a product or process. They can point out what on the site is significant, what users feel is important, and what ideas for improvement they may have.

> :gem: **Designer Insight:** Share how user interviews play a role in your work.

**How many user interviews should you do? Start with five interviews.**

Five interviews can identify 80% of themes within a data set.

- There’s no correct number. Start with five and increase by five, depending on domain complexity.

- NN/g suggests that five usability test subjects will yield 80% of the problems, and many have associated that testing with the Pareto Principle or the 80/20 rule.

**What is the Five Whys Method?**

1. What it is:

    - The Five Whys Method is a technique used to identify the root cause of a problem.

    - The technique's primary goal is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?"

2. When it is used:

    - When problems involve human factors or interactions.

    - In day-to-day business life, it can be used conceptually within user interviews.

3. Why it matters:

    - Help recognize a problem's root cause.

    - Identify the relationship between the different root causes of a problem.

- It is simple: easy to complete without statistical analysis.

- The Five Whys is a simple method for understanding your users and uncovering insights about their behaviors.

## SLIDE 74
**About the Five Whys**

- Using the Five Whys is as simple as it sounds—you ask “why” five times.

  - The Five Whys, invented by Taiichi Ohno and Sakichi Toyoda, was created for getting to the root cause of problems in Toyota’s factories.

**information_source: TAs please Slack out** 
  - [Five Whys: The Ultimate Root Cause Analysis Tool](https://kanbanize.com/lean-management/improvement/5-whys-analysis-tool/)

## SLIDE 75
- The Five Whys Method prompts you to ask “Why?” so a user can explain further.

- Each “Why?” nudges the user to reevaluate a position and delve deeper into the reasoning.

- At first, it might seem odd to keep asking “why,” but it yields great insights while searching for the root causes of behaviors.

In this example, we can visualize how we might use the Five Whys Method to understand a real-world problem better.

Problem statement: You're on your way home from work, and your car stops in the middle of the road.

1. Why did your car stop? Because it ran out of gas.

2. Why did it run out of gas? Because I didn’t buy any gas on my way to work.

3. Why didn’t you buy any gas this morning? Because I didn’t have any money.

4. Why didn’t you have any money? Because I lost it all last night in a poker game.

5. Why did you lose your money in last night’s poker game? Because I’m not very good at “bluffing” when I don’t have a good hand.

**Summary**

We want students to grasp the process of digging deeper to identify a root cause by asking why. This is an opportunity to practice extracting meaningful information from users.

**Instructions:**

> :globe_with_meridians: Introduce the use of breakout rooms. Let students know we will be using these regularly through out the UX/UI curriculum. We will get faster at this over time but the first breakout room might be more time consuming. Send group to their breakout rooms. Keep 1 group in the main room to preserve the class recording. Give students a little time to get into the activity before you and the TAs jump around into breakout rooms to see how it's going and help students course-correct.

1. Create the breakout rooms for student pairs.
2. Set a timer for five minutes.
3. When five minutes are up, have students switch roles with their partner.

   - Use Slack @channel to let all students know it is time to switch.

4. Students should use Zoom's raise hands feature to request help or ask questions.

**Instructor and TAs**

Zoom and collaboration will be essential so help students quickly get into the activities.

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online recommendation:** Before sending students into breakout room get a thumbs up everyone is clear on the activity.

*For students who struggle with the Five Whys*: Make sure they are using active listening and following up the first why question with another why.

*For students who complete the activity early:* Suggest they do a second round of Five Whys with a question of their choice. Practice with the method should reveal the root of a decision/problem.

**Deliverable**

- A Five Whys interview with notes and students with some insights

> :globe_with_meridians: **Online recommendation:** Before bringing everyone back from the Zoom breakout rooms, use Slack to give groups a warning to wrap up. Use Slack @channel to send the message: "We'll be completing the group activity in two minutes. Does anyone need more time?" If students need more time, extend the activity and shorten the review.

## SLIDE 81
## 18. Instructor Do: Five Whys Activity Review (5 min)

Students should return to the main class screen so that you can lead a review of the activity.

With this review, you'll help students think even more deeply about getting to the root of a problem through why questions.

> :globe_with_meridians: Call on a student and ask them to come off mute with their partner.

First, lead a class discussion. Ask the following:

- How did the activity go?
- What did you learn?

Call on a student to share what they learned. Ask the following:
- What went wrong, if anything?
- What would you do differently next time?

Finally, provide students with a few pieces of ***actionable feedback*** that they can apply directly to their work the next time they try this skill. For example:

- Design is about learning through failure. Sometimes we succeed and sometimes we don't, but we always learn through practice. By practicing the Five Whys, our questions will improve and, over time, yield better user data.
- This exercise is about getting to the root of a problem so make sure to stay curious and listen!

> **Instructor Note:** Take questions. This is the final review, so ensure that all students are up to speed. Encourage anyone with further questions to stay online for office hours.

## SLIDE 82
## 19. Instructor Do: Recap (2 min)

> :pushpin: **Important Point:** Your goal is to high-five students.

***You did it!***

Your students completed their first lesson and now have a clearer understanding of UX and the design thinking process.

Congratulate everyone on their first class.

***Review key concepts to lock in today's learning:*** Invite students to use Slack to give their answers or use Zoom's raise hands feature to respond to the following questions.

- Question 1: How is UX defined?

  - Answer: UX is a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system, or service.

- Question 2: What is the design thinking process?

  - Answer: Design thinking refers to the cognitive, strategic, and practical processes by which design concepts are developed.

- Question 3: What are the high-level learning goals for this boot camp and becoming a UX/UI designer?
  - Possible answers: Growing your human-centered design skills, building low- and high-fidelity prototypes, and improving your 21st century design skills that will help you create solutions for users and land a new job.

- Question 4: What is a proto-persona and its purpose?
  - Possible answers: Proto-personas are an ad hoc, non-research-backed articulation of a customer archetype. Proto-personas are used as a starting point. It is the role of the researchers to validate or invalidate the proto-persona, they are an empathy-building exercise useful starting the human-centered user research and design process.

Next class, we’ll cover more on user research with proto-personas, interview questions, and planning.

Take any final questions and invite students to stay online for office hours.

***Tell students:***

- You have taken your first step toward a career as a UX/UI designer.
- This class will move quickly—after all, it's a boot camp!
- Office hours are in your best interest, so utilize them.

Wish everyone a good night.

Great job!
