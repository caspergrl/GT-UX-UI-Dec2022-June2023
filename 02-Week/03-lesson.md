## 2.3 UX Storytelling

### Overview

Last class, students learned about useful tools to use during the *Ideation* phase of the design thinking process, such as I Like, I Wish, What if method and creating a feature prioritization matrix. This enabled them to narrow the focus on which ideas or features they want to design for the user.

Today's class will continue to focus on tools that are part of the *Ideation* phase of the design thinking process. The three tools that you will guide students in learning and practicing are:

-User scenarios.

-Storyboards. 

-User journey maps.

As you guide students deeper into *ideation* fundamentals with those three tools, you will teach them an appreciation for storytelling and its power in communicating design ideas.  

This will enable your students to be able to move a step closer to having the information they need and an understanding of the user needed to eventually prototype a design.  

### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

- Create a user scenario based on a problem statement.

- Build a storyboard based on their user scenario. 

- Create a user journey map using their user scenario and storyboard in Adobe XD.

### Instructor Notes

- **Today's Slides**

  Here are your slides for today: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e-4kSUY0NMsAENL7mfAKiVJy1F3pTecEpDWH43q9CO0/edit#slide=id.g480f0dd0a7_0_1809

- **Review the Slides Beforehand**

  Take time to review the slides before class and make teaching notes. As you lecture, relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future goals.

- Make sure your students know that the work they complete today in class will be needed for the activities scheduled for the next lecture. The knowledge and skills covered today will be built on in future classes.

- **Read Activity Instructions Out Loud**

  Students will be able to more readily dive into their Activities if you provide verbal guidance. There's no need to read the instructions word for word, but do summarize the key steps. 

- **Keep Track of Time**

  Be sure to keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the Time Tracker: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BU_UmY_-tNT61p85T9n9EZjWZwBD0ldRDYXcntL1zYM/edit?usp=sharing

  For the in-class Student Activities, use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start of activities. 

  You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found[ here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome + Objectives (5 min)

Welcome students to class.

> Remind students that Office Hours are to be taken advantage of and that you are very happy to answer their questions and hear what they think about the design process. 
>
> Office hours take place both before *and* after class.

Today's theme is storytelling. 

In the last class, students generated and then narrowed down the ideas and features that were important to their user and solve an identified problem. In this class, students are going to apply storytelling tools to that information in order to communicate how and why the ideas and features will ultimately help users (and sell products). 

Let students know that today's lesson will focus on three tools that help designers tell stories about users, enabling them to communicate effectively to their team, client, and the business.

The three tools are: user scenarios, storyboards, and user journey mapping. They increase in complexity, so we are going to be practicing the simplest one first—user scenarios—and then moving onto the more complex storyboards and even more complex user journey maps. 

In the real-world, design teams use these tools all at once, rather than in a sequence. But the best way to learn then is in a sequence that moves from simplest to most complex. 

## 2. Instructor Do: Storytelling & User Scenario (10 min)

> :pushpin: The goal of this section of the lesson is to help students appreciate storytelling as integral to design work and communication and show them how a user scenario is created. 

We're going to talk about storytelling and focus on one of the three storytelling tools that we'll learn about today, *user scenarios*. To do this, we'll first discuss the concept of storytelling. Then, we'll discuss usser scenarios as a storytelling tool. 

For context, storytelling and user scenarios both fall within the *Ideation* phase of the design thinking process. Developing stories about users helps designers form ideas and share those ideas (*idea*-tion) with their team and business stakeholders.

**Steve Job's Storytelling Quote**

To begin, ask a TA or student to read the following Steve Jobs quote for the class—or divide it up between two students:

*"The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values, and agenda of an entire generation that is to come."* 

## SLIDE 6
**Storytelling and UX:**

Humans have always told stories. UX desigers are no different.  

- As we try to design new experiences, there is a lot we can learn from storytelling.

- In user experience design, we invent things people have never experienced before.

- People share experiences through stories.

- The ability to tell a compelling story about your design that conveys its value is an important skill.


## SLIDE 7
**The Five Key Elements of Storytelling:**

1. **Exposition:**  Main character (hero)
   - Remember that your user is the hero.

   - Your product (or service/brand) is not the hero.
2. **Rising Action**: Introduces the conflict
  - Explains *why* the conflict is important and *how* it affects the characters.

3. **Climax**: conflict
  - The characters are forced to confront the source of the conflict.
  - UX design is all about solving problems for your user.
  - Therefore, you need to have a solid understanding of your user's pain points (problems or conflicts).
4. **Falling Action**:  Resolution
  - Shows how the characters have changed.
  - How does your product solve the user's problems?
  - What does the main character feeling after using your product?
5. **Resolution:**  Goal Achievement
   1. The story ends and it should be satisfying to most readers.

*Stories are Good Business:* 

- Stories drive ROI because it helps designers communicate the story to the business and it helps the business understand how to sell the product.

**User Scenarios**

Now that we have a sense of how storytelling is a powerful tool in UX design, let's take a look at one of the three tools we'll be practicing today that will help us tell stories about our users: user scenarios.

As a reminder, storytelling and the user scenarios that help us tell stories are both fall within the *Ideation* phase of the design thinking process. Developing stories about users helps designers form ideas and share those ideas (*idea*-tion) with their team and business stakeholders. 

Why Do I Need User Scenarios?

  - It is important not only to get to know the actual users, but also to understand the goals these users have.

  - We can only define design requirements to meet these goals when we know who does what on our website, and how and why they do it.

When Do I Need User Scenarios?

  - You need user scenarios whenever you design any kind of user interface.

  - So, pretty much always.

  - It answers the following questions:

    - Who is the user I’m designing for?

    - What does this user want on my site or app?

    - How is this user going to achieve his or her goals?

    - Why does this user come to my site and not anywhere else?



## SLIDE 13
- **User scenarios** are short stories that clearly define how a user interacts with a product or service.

  - They have three main components: persona, scenario, and goal(s).

  - The _persona_ defines who the story is about.

  - The _goal_ defines what the persona wants.

  - The _scenario_ defines the when, where, and how.

## 3. Student Do: User Scenario Activity (15 min)

Slack students the following file:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKDeCYRlqhjtCfAqORssAHalTPByyjV401C-tHnKFII/edit?usp=sharing

**Instructions**

Students are going to do Part One and Part Two of the activity. 

They will create a user scenario from one of the ideas they generated in their I Like, I Wish, What If activity from last class.  

They have the option to draw a user scenario grid by hand, or use either the Google sheet or the Aodbe XD template for their work. They will complete the four sections for user/persona, goals, user scenario, and risks/emotions. As a bonus, they can complete the phase funnel section. 

*TAs—set a time for 15 minutes for students to iterate their user scenario.*

**Deliverable**

Students will generate a user scenario using Adobe XD.   

## SLIDE 21
## 6. Instructor Do: User Scenario Review (15 min)

Call attention back to the front of the room.

Tell students—*"Now let's take a look at what our classmates have done with their user scenarios!"* 

Choose a user scenario to reivew and lead the students in a class feedback session: 

- Invite various students to answer the following questions: 
- Does the scenario have a compelling story?
  - Ask another student: Does the story have a persona, goal, and setting?

  - Have that student call on a different student to share their work.

Review as many user scenarios as time allows.

Spend the remaining time of this review emphasizing the importance of user scenarios.

- If applicable, explain why and how you have used scenarios in any previous jobs.

- Ask your TAs if they have any experience to share about storyboards.

> Pause and ask for questions. Use the "twenty seconds of silence" trick—ask if anyone has a question, and then count to twenty slowly before moving on (at least one student will ask a question.)  

Now that you have introduced students to the simplest form of storytelling, a user scenario, it's time to move on to a more complex tool for visually expressing user scenarios—in the form of storyboards. Students can think of storyboards as a way of brining their user scenarios "to life."

**Storyboards**

Storyboards help designers understand the flow of people's interaction with a product over time. Storyboards enables your team to iterate quickly.

UX and Storyboards:

- In order to make our product better, we must understand what’s going on in our user's world and how our product can make their lives better. This is where storyboards come in.

- **Storyboards** are illustrations that visually predict and explore a user's experience with a product.

- Like User Scenarios, storyboards are another tool to help us empathize with our users.

- This method originated in Hollywood.

Storyboards:

- Are a low-fidelity artifact.

- Are useful for when you work with stakeholders such as execs, product, marketing, engineering, or sales.

- Are a powerful tool because they are:

  - Visual: Pictures are worth a thousand words.

  - Memorable: We remember stories much more than facts. (Ever watch the news?)

  - Empathic and engaging: As consumers, we empathize when we imagine ourselves in the shoes of a character.

**How to Design a Storyboard**

  1. Choose a persona and scenario.

  2. Plan out the panels.

     - Think through the steps you want to draw out.

     - Using your user scenario, try to identify 5-6 steps your user would take as they interact with your product.

  3. Add visuals.

     - Happy or sad faces can help inform your storyboard sketches.

     - Stick figures are just fine for illustrations.

  4. Distribute and iterate.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/186drfihPtx-2QVDSk2qu58op7GpUjkGcNuaBKxzbrHg/edit?usp=sharing

**Instructions**

In this activity, students will create a Storyboard that shows the flow of their user’s actions that lead them to the product and shows their interactions with the product.  They will write out the steps of the scenario, including: a beginning, rising action/crisis, climax, falling action, and ending resolution. 

Students will refer to both their User Scenario and Persona for this activity.

They should follow the instructions for Parts One to Five in the activity document. (They should not proceed to Part Six.)

*TAs—set a timer for 20 minutes.* 

**Outcome**

Students will produce a storyboard that embodies rising and falling action, with a climax and resolution, for their user.

## 12. Instructor Do: Storyboard Review (10 min)

Over the past 45 or so minutes, students have come to understand storyboards from several perspectives: they've *seen* an example of a storyboard, *heard* from you about the value of a storyboard, and have *created* and iterated a storyboard on their own. 

In this review, you will bring everything about storyboards full-circle so that students fully integrate what they've learned from the last three storyboard activities. 

Call the class back to attention:

- Call on a student to share their experience creating the storyboard.

- Ask a student one of the following questions:

  - When they reviewed a storyboard, was the story compelling? Why?

  - Did providing feedback help you think critically about your own work? Why?

- Spend the remaining time of this review emphasizing the importance of constructive feedback.

  - If applicable, explain why and how you have used storyboards in any previous jobs.

  - Ask your TAs if they have an experience to share about storyboards.

**User Journey Maps**

Journey Mapping:

- A widely used tool that combines storytelling and visualization.

  - Visualizes the flow and feelings that users experience as they use a product.

  - Describes a sequence of events, such as purchasing behavior or taking a trip.

**Why User Journey Map?**

We study and map out the path of a user in order to better understand it and look for design opportunities.

We use them to understand how the user experience of one customer segment (aka persona) differs from another segment.

- To understand what motivates your customers or users: their needs, hesitations, and concerns.

  - To identify friction and pain points.

**When to Use User Journey Maps**

Create a journey map **before** you start designing screens to ideate on different flows and find the one that fits the user needs.

A user journey is best used when you know there is a problem but you don’t know exactly where the problem is.

    - Usually based on qualitative research.  
    - Emotional journey
  4. Touchpoints and Channels.  
    - Aligns touchpoints and channels with user goals and actions  
    - Touchpoints: Times when the user actually interacts with the product  
    - Channels: Methods of communication or service delivery, such as the mobile app  
  5. Insights and Ownership   
    - The entire point of the journey-mapping process is to uncover gaps in the user experience. 
    - Then we fill those gaps!  
    - This is how we slowly turn someone into a long-term, loyal customer.
