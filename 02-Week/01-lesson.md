## 2.1 Lesson Plan - Definition Phase

---

### Overview

Welcome to Week Two! 

In their first week, your students learned about the *Empathy/Research* phase of the design process, which included creating empathy maps. They also explored a bit of the *Definition* phase, which included creating user personas. 

As this week begins, students will continue with the *Definition* phase of the design thinking process and move into the *Ideation* phase. This means they'll be getting to work with tools such as user insights, problem statements, and forming "How Might We…?" questions. 

Although the design thinking process is taught linearly in the classroom, it's not a linear process for designers in practice. For that reason, be sure to help students make the distinction between a process that is taught linearly and experienced in the real world non-linearly.  You can help students understand that in reality, designers spend time going back and forth between various phases of the design thinking process, as needed.  

This matters because we want students to be able to step into any part of the process and be successful. We will help them practice from start to finish so that when they get a job, they can hit the ground running.

Today's class is divided into three parts: 

- In Part One, you'll teach user insights. 
- In Part Two, you'll cover "How Might We…?" questions. 
- In Part Three, students will learn how to build Problem Statements.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

- Articulate user insights and write a user insight statement.
- Write "How Might We…?" Statements.
- Build Problem Statements.

### Instructor Notes

- **Today's Slides**

Here is your slide deck for today:[ slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11l6DkGcA-NmCdlQ4zcsTchSLkP-mSUOf0-j24QRmSlE/edit#slide=id.g5528cec994_7_0).

- **Review the Slides Beforehand**

Review the slides before class, and make any teaching notes you'll need. As you lecture, relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future goals.

- **Introduce Each Student Activity** 

Students will be able to dive into their Activities if you provide verbal guidance. There's no need to read the instructions word for word, but do summarize the key steps. 

  Read the activity instructions aloud.

- **Working in Groups** 

Encourage your class to work in paris or groups in order to not only help them move through activities in class and learn from their peers, but also to prepare them for teamwork as a designer.

- **Help Studens Write Strong Problem Statements**
  
  Extra time should be spent reviewing students' Problem Statements. 
Problem statements are the starting place for ideation. They will use these statements as the basis for their mobile app case study.
  
- **Use Time-Keeping Tools**
  

Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the TimeTracker: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12zdN_8slPfL00L_leqTz11yM431XP-s4nrpUrLzmRQI/edit#gid=1086546131

  For the in-class Student Activities, use an online timer, which you or your TA can set at the start of activities. You can add a timer to your Chrome browser, found[ here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj?hl=en).

  > Encourage your students to make the most out of class, and to not be afraid to ask questions. Remind them that you're availabe for Office Hours before *and* after class.

- **See how another instructor is teaching this material**

Watch a sample video of this class being taught by Hannah Patellis: (https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0a77d9ac-fd6d-4d0d-94da-aa5401728cbc) 

- **Have FUN**
  
  Lastly, have fun out there!
  
  Don’t forget, you are making a huge difference in these students' lives.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome, Class Objectives + Introduce Homework (5 min)

Welcome students to class.

Open your slides for today:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=11l6DkGcA-NmCdlQ4zcsTchSLkP-mSUOf0-j24QRmSlE

**Class Objectives**:

Today's class objectives describe three real-world design frameworks and tools that students will learn how to use: 

- Use research data to write User Insight Statements.
- Produce “How Might We...?” questions.
- Build Problem Statements from user insights and “How Might We…?” questions.

**Homework 2:**

> :pushpin: Your goal is to be sure students know that the week's in-class activites will prepare them to complete their homework assignment. 
>
> Reassure students:  There is no need to stress out about the homework assignment. Students are not supposed to be able to complete the homework immediately. As the week progresses, they will have learned everything they need to know to complete the homework.

Last week, students worked through the *Empathy* phase of the design process by gathering user research. They also moved into the *Definition* phase. 

This week, they will continue with the *Definition* phase and get into the *Ideation* phase of the design process. 

- Open the homework in front of the class - [Week 2 Homework File](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12M9HK5Xt-0sBQPBWejF1XW9BQhE1NGjlLLf6Laq6k4U)
- Read through the instructions with the class.

Emphasize what students are learning to do. By week's end, they will be able to create the following:

-User Insight Statement

-Problem Statement

-Feature Prioritization Matrix

-Value Proposition

-Competitor Analysis

-Storyboards 

-User Journey Map

> Before moving on,  ask the class if anyone has any questions.

*TAs—Be sure to make/download a copy to share with the class via Slack.*

## 2. Instructor Do: User Personas & User Insights (15 min)

> :pushpin: Your goal for this section is to show students how User Insight Statements are written and why they are important. 

## SLIDES 1-4
Review

## SLIDE 5
**Definition Phase Recap**

The *Definition* phase is where designers synthesize observations about their users from the Empathy/Research stage. The goal of the *Definition* phase is to define a problem statement. 

Once designers have a well-developed problem statement, that will kickstart the ideation process, which is part of the *Ideation* phase. 

*The Design Thinking Process is not linear*.

The design thinking process *isn't linear*, and that although you're moving linearly through the phases, design teams don't. They go back and forth between all phases, as needed.  


*Aspects of the Empathy/Research and Definition Phases*:

- *Analysis* 

Analysis is about breaking down complex concepts and problems into smaller, easier-to-understand constituents. We do that, for instance, during the first stage of the Design Thinking process, the *Empathy/Research* stage, when we observe and document details that relate to our users. 

- *Synthesis*
  
  By contrast, synthesis involves creatively piecing the puzzle together to form whole ideas. This happens during the *Definition* stage when we organize, interpret, and make sense of the data we have gathered to create a problem statement.

## SLIDE 6
**Definition Phase and Problem Statement**

Introduce the concept of a Problem Statement.

*Remember how I said, "The goal of the Definition phase is to define a problem statement?" Anyone wonder how designers create problem statements?* 

**Definition Phase and Problem Statement Components**

Again, the goal of the *Definition* phase is to define a problem statement. 

What do we need in order to create a problem statement?

- User Persona or Empathy Map
- User Insight Statement
- A "How Might We…?" Question

Students have already learned how to do the first of these—user persona and empathy map—which they learned last week. Now, you will expalin the final piece of the problem statement puzzle, which is how to develop user insights.

## SLIDE 8
**User Insights**

User insights are the end-goal of all user research done by design teams. When done well, they are meaningful to design teams, businesses, and help guide designers in finding solutions that are meaningful to users.

*What exactly are user insights?*

  - User insights...
  - Help designers identify unmet needs
  - Develop a deeper understanding of a person or user.
  - Validate designers' ideas
      - Insights become fuel for both validating ideas as well as solving problems later in the process. 
  - Unlock strategic innovations
      - The purpose is to discover the underlying motivations, identify unmet needs, validate ideas, and unlock strategic innovations!

> An insight goes deep, exploring the user’s goal as well as the opportunity that goal might afford us and why we believe it’s a good problem to solve.

  - Identify unmet needs.

  - Validate ideas.

  - Unlock strategic innovations.


## SLIDE 9
*Great research insights have the following characteristics:*

  - Grounded in real data and research.

  - Simple in language and concept.

  - Meaningful and memorable.

  - Speak to your audience.

  - Inspire clear, direct action.

## SLIDE 10
**User Insights - Tips for building great user insights**

*TIP #1:  Share Relevant Insight.*

- For example: Say 8 out of 10 people surveyed were unhappy with the restaurant options they found near their hotel.

- During user interviews, we heard participants mention their preference for staying with family if possible [when traveling] because “having a kitchen or washing machine makes it so much simpler while I’m away from home.”

*TIP #2: Explain the conclusion you’ve come to based on the insight.*

- For example: Users might have a more pleasant experience while traveling if they could manage to feel “at home” anywhere.

*TIP #3: Articulate the design concept by revealing your actual idea in a few sentences.*

- For example: We could find a way to connect people who travel with locals who are willing to rent out their apartment or home for a while. That way, while traveling, people can feel at home ANYWHERE.

*TIP #4: Communicate how the concept will be conveyed in the project or design you’re creating.*

- For example: We might use a format for finding a home to rent that is similar to how users might book a flight or hotel.

- And host homes can be anything! An entire house, RV, or treehouse.

*TIP #5: Reveal the reason why you’re executing the project.*

- For example: We think this might be the next new thing in travel and hospitality!

- We want to inspire people to travel, and we want individuals to be able to earn money while opening their homes to others!

- Voila, we've invented Airbnb!

**How To Write A User Insight**

The goal of an insight statment is to identify the user and their need and to add an insightful idea as well.

The key to writing User Insights is to iterate them. So think of it as a two-step process. 

**Step 1: Write a User Insight POV**

Feel free to liken the following format to a MadLib game: 

**[User / Persona]** needs to **[User / Persona Need]** because of **[surprising insight].**

For example: 

A **teenage boy** need more **nutritious food** because **vitamin are vital to good health.**

## SLIDE 14
**Step 2: Consider your user**

For example: 

A **teenage boy with a bleak outlook** needs to **feel more socially accepted when eating healthy food,** because **in his neighborhood a social risk is more dangerous than a health risk.**

Remind students about the value of iteration, which is part and parcel to the design process. 

Writers say that “writing is editing”—because the stories they write come to life during the editing phase. It’s similar in the design field; in design, “design is iteration.”  

*It's key that studnets get as much practice with iteration as possible, now and when they become paid UI designers*.   

Three things to keep in mind for the iteration of the User Insight:

- Say *even more* about who the user is.
- Expose more of their problem and need—expand on it.
- Develop the insight more deeply, think: "What's at stake?"

## SLIDE 15
**Step 3: Challenge your first assumption**

It's now time to iterate on our first assumption. Designers do this by thinking about the emotions that a user feels, as well as their needs. 

For example: 

A **teenage boy with a bleak outlook** needs to **feel more socially accepted when eating healthy food,** because **in his neighborhood a social risk is more dangerous than a health risk.**

## SLIDE 16
**Step 4: Evaluate your user insight versions**

It's important to look back at previous iterations in order to fully appreciate what iteration brings to design. Students should appreciate how significantly their insight statements improved after just one iteration! 

Before:

A **teenage boy** needs more **nutritious food** because **vitamin are vital to good health.**

After:

A **teenage boy with a bleak outlook** needs to **feel more socially accepted when eating healthy food,** because **in his neighborhood a social risk is more dangerous than a health risk.**

TAs—*set a timer for 10 minutes.*

**What Students Learn**
In this activity, students will create insight statements using the fill-in-the-black MadLib format provided. This teaches them how to condense their knowledge about their user and their problem into a concise form. 

**Support Students as They Learn**

- Be sure to have that TAs circulate around the room as the students do this work. You should, too. 

- Be on the lookout for:
  - Clarity—does the statement make sense?
  - Balance—does the insight make sense when compared to the user and user problem?
  - Be on the lookout for students who get stuck—suggest alternative approaches to the work.

**Connect this to real-life:** Be sure to tell students that real-world designers use insight statements regularly to deeply understand their user and to communicate who their user is to stakeholders in the business. For a designer, being able to communicate a user's issue concisely enables them to be compelling—and help stakeholders make informed decisions. 

## SLIDE 19
## 4. Student Do: Peer Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

Tell students to get into pairs. 

They are going to review one another's User Insights and discuss what they like and what could be different. 

**Guidelines**:

*Considerations for students' review of their classmate's work:*

- Does the user insight statement define a clear problem and insight?
- Is it clear who the user is?
- Is it clear what their problem is?
- Is it clear what insight the designer has into their problem?

*Students should provide feedback using the following format:*

- "I think this is a compelling insight because…"
- Note 1-2 things you like about the user insight.
- "I think you could improve…"
  - Note 1-2 things you think could be improved.

Remind students that the feedback they are giving and receiving here is very important; it will be the basis for iterating their user insight.

Review

## SLIDE 21

"How Might We…?" questions are short questions that launch brainstorms and spark ideation. They are short questions but *broad enough* for a wide range of solutions yet *narrow enough* that the team has boundaries for their ideas.

"How Might We…?" questions are used to break up the user problem into smaller, actionable pieces. These pieces can be aspects of the larger problem or they can be challenges that are specific to a certain group of people that should be considered when creating a product or service for that group of people.

Some words that go well with How Might We questions include:

- Know, define, or identify

- Understand, predict, or associate

- Apply, solve, or construct

- Analyze, focus, or test

- Evaluate, reframe, or support

- Create, develop, or modify

Finally, the very best way to understand "How Might We…?" questions is to see examples of them. Here are a few sample HWM questions:  

- *How might we* increase quality of life for a single day for homeless people in Los Angeles? 

- *How might we* make the airport experience more like a spa or playground for International travelers? 

- *How might we* embrace and celebrate the dripping of an ice cream cone?

- *How might we* make cat carriers alluring and safe-feeling to pets? 

## SLIDE 23
Review

## SLIDE 24
**How Might We questions - They have two parts**

Designers create "How Might We…?" questions in two parts—one part problem and one part a statement of the resolution of the problem.

***Part 01 Problem Identification***
This is a statement, or two or more, about the problems that exist for the user. It's a plain statement, written like fact. 

1. People have blockers regarding donating to the homeless.
2. Homeless people have blockers that prevent them from improving their quality of life for today.

***Part 02 Impact Statement***
This impact statement describes the impact that the designers want the product to have—the end result, or the ultimate value of the app (or website) to the user.  For example: 

- *To increase the quality of life for a single day for a homeless person in Los Angeles.* 

## SLIDE 25
Review

## SLIDE 26

To determine if a HMW question is good, designers use the following criteria to evaluate it:

1. **Is the question focused on ultimate impact?** Yes, because it has an outcome that may be measurable.
2. **Does the question allow for a variety of solutions?** Yes, as there is no defined product, services or technologies to be used.
3. **Does the question take into account context and constraints?** Yes, because it is clear that this is focused on homeless people in Los Angeles, a city where the design team is located.

Slack out the activity instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16iVXciRZofSCtQlxLcgudrW-OEtX9WODZqLrv4ZG3ZM/edit?usp=sharing

*TAs—set a timer for 10 minutes.*

**What Students Learn**
In this activity, students will define a "How Might We…?" question for their user persona. They will do this by first identifying a couple problems and writing an impact statement. They'll then transform those into "How Might We…?" question. 

This activity gives students further practice with looking at user problems (and potential solutions) from different points of view—a critical skill for any designer. 

**User Problem - Example #1**

1. We believe that Anya Cho wants to help needy people in her community, but finds it hard to connect to like-minded individuals who might help her tackle the needs of vulnerable people. By introducing a platform that lets people in need post a daily cause, we may help her solve this problem by helping her network with other people who want to help volunteer in the local community.

*Here's how that problem would look parsed into "How Might We…?" questions:*

- How might we increase quality of life in local communities?
- How might we connect like-minded individuals in a community to one another?
- How might we determine what poor people in our communities need?
- How might we help social activists to promote their community outreach online?

**User Problem - Example #2** 

2. We believe that Angelina Lopez has trouble saving money to send her kids to college, due to having a large family and low pay. We believe that by introducing a way for Angelina Lopez to track how much she is saving each month for each of her children's individual tuitions, we may solve this problem by providing the peace of mind that comes with knowing exactly when each goal will be met.

*And here's how that problem would look parsed into "How Might We…?" questions:*

- *How might we* track individual goals concurrently?
- *How might we* give peace of mind to busy parents or goal-oriented people?
- *How might we* help blue-collar families with limited finances plan for their futures?
- *How might we* give a clear timeline for a specific goal to be met?

**Support Students as They Learn**

To reinforce your lesson on "How Might We…?" questions and to test for student competency, you can ask your students questions like these:
1. What purpose do How Might We Statements have for UX researchers?
2. Are How Might We Statements focused or broad?
3. Why are How Might We Statements generated from problem statements?

Be sure to pause for any final, remaining questions about the "How Might We…?" concept.

The ability to write and present a solid problem statement is a skill of paramount importance to a designer. It's critical to the ability to clearly define problems as well as communicate opportunities to stakeholders in the business.

Enviable skills are not easy to come by. Like all notable skills, they take practice to develop. Take the skill of negotiation, for example. It's a skill of paramount importance in professions like politics and law, and one that take a good deal of practice and a variety of techniques, too.

Problem statements are similar, in that it takes applying tools and techniques to arrive at a good problem statement. A good problem statement isn't created by chance. And a great problem statement, like a great negotiation, reduces confusion and is extremely persuasive.

Say — *Remember the three tools that you need in order to create a problem statement?* 

They are:  User Persona (or Empathy Map), User Insight Statement, and the "How Might We…?" Question. 

**Problem Statements**

*A problem statement identifies the gap between the current state and the desired state of a process or product.* 

Within the design context, you can think of the user problem as an unmet need. By designing a solution that meets this need, you can satisfy the user and ensure a pleasant user experience.

Problem Statements are created at the very beginning of a project, in the *Definition* phase.

  - Problem Statements are...
      - Clearly describe a problem that needs to be addressed.
      - State a vision and methods that will help solve the problem.
      - Are meant to be shared, so they should be concise.

A Problem Statement *Should*...

- Describe a very specific problem in 1-2 sentences
- Provide context for the problem  
- Pizza vs. Pizza dropped on the street 
- Define a clear outcome or solution: 
- What business performance metric, or emotion, are you hoping this problem statement improves?
- Be aware of business constraints: 
- The real world dictates businesses need to make money. How much runway a team has to work on a problem is part of the business constraints.
- A Problem Statement *Should Not*...

  - Provide a solution.

  - Assign blame.

  - Get too large.

  - Address multiple problems.

Students now know who their user is; however, they don't yet know what problem to solve. 

That's OK. They are making great progress.

In this activity, students will execute their problem statements—using Adobe XD.

While real world designers do not always use Adobe XD for creating problem statements, this is an opportunity for students to gain familiarity with the tool. So, if they ask, let them know it's a way to "kill two birds with one stone," getting practice with two new experiences at once.

*TAs—Slack students the following two links:*

Activity Instructions:

- To begin, students should get into groups of two. 

- They should download files from the two links above (shared via Slack)

- Students should first choose a user persona

- Then they can fill out the MadLib template with their partner

- Switch and repeat, so that each of the pair can work from their user persona

Finally, have the students export their problem statements as .PNG file and share on Slack

## 16. Instructor Do: Review (15 min)

First, call attention back to the front of the class. 

Help students appreciate the power of a problem statement, and point out that several tools helped them create it—the User Persona or Empathy Map, User Insight Statement, and the "How Might We…?" Question.

While your students just practiced defining problems themselves, as a group of students, it will be different in the real world. As a professional, a designer's poblem statement is the single most powerful tool they can use to influence *clients* and *stakeholders*. 

Then, lead the class in a peer critique.  

1. Choose a file from Slack and open it.
2. Ask the student to verbally walk everyone through their process.

3. Invite the student as well as the whole class to provide feedback:

- *What is one thing you like about this problem statement?*

- *What is one thing you would do differently?*

Try and give as much feedback on problem statement as possible.

Next, choose 2-4 additional student problem statement from Slack, and repeat the critique process. 

Finally, be sure to emphasize the importance of a problem statement. For example, if possible, draw from your own experience and share an anecdote about the moment you realized how powerful and persuasive a problem statement was in your own professional work.

If you can't think of an example, here's a quote to share:

**"A problem well stated is half solved” — Charles Kettering** (American engineer, inventor, and head of research for General Motors' in the 1940s)

Essentially, if a designer's problem statement isn't good, they will not solve the problem. In fact, the outcome could be a failed project, unhappy customer, and laughable product.
