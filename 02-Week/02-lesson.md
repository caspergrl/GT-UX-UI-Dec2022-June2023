## 2.2 UX/Design Thinking + Ideation

### Overview

Last class, you completed your walk through the *Definition* phase of the design process and its tools, and moved into the *Ideation* phase. Today's class continues along with the *Ideation* phase and the tools designers use as part of their ideation process. 

This lesson has four learning arcs:

1. First you'll walk students through using the I Like, I Wish, What If method of ideation and brainstorming.
2. Second, you'll show them how to create a feature prioritization matrix.
3. Third, you will explain how competitor analysis works as it relates to UX.
4. Fourth, you'll  walk students through creating value propositions.

Additionally, so that students begin to get a bit of exposure to the business side of user experience, you'll be showing them a business model canvas as well.

### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

- Put ideation and brainstorming into practice with the "What if, I Like, I Wish" method.

- Use a feature prioritization matrix to practice prioritizing features.

- Create a competitor analysis.

- Define a value proposition statement. 

### Instructor Notes

- **Today's Slides**

  Here are your slides for today's lesson: 

  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tf41FNiEFwADDUU8v4fPd2S-2GqcuW8wP9oHnk0_cyk/edit

- **Review the Slides Beforehand**

  Review the slides before class, and make any teaching notes you'll need. As you lecture, relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future goals.

- **Student Activities Build Upon Each Other**

  Make sure your students know that the work they complete today in class will be needed for the activities scheduled for the next lecture. The knowledge and skills covered today will be built on in future classes.

- **Working in Groups** 

  Encourage your class to work in pairs or groups in order to not only help them move through activities in class and learn from their peers, but also to prepare them for teamwork as a designer.

- **Read Activity Instructions Out Loud** 

  Students will be able to more readily dive into their Activities if you provide verbal guidance. There's no need to read the instructions word for word, but do summarize the key steps. 

- **Keep track of the Clock.**

  - Have TAs consult the Time Tracker: [02-Week/03-Time Trackers/02.2 Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dgOaEIy2jsjsTXGGJ_YTABmAdS8AkGvFLN_DDIu2maQ/edit#gid=71637037)

- **Empower TAs to participate**

  TAs can help you stay on track and can add texture to your lesson. Encorage their participation and input.

- **Watch a class**

  [Class Video:](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7e6d3453-65ad-4a5a-b6d2-aa560173009c) Watch a sample video of this class being taught by Hannah Patellis.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome, Ideation & Brainstorming (10 min)

> :pushpin: The goal for this section of the lesson plan is to teach students that brainstorming is a powerful process that generates potential solutions to design problems. You will also show students the I lIke, I Wish, What If method for generating ideas. 

It's time to talk to your students about ideation and brainstorming. These are incredibly important aspects of the design process because they are the bridge between having a user problem and solving the user's problem. To be clear, brainstorming doesn't solve the problem, rather it generates creative ideas that propel designers toward possible solutions. 

**Ideation & Brainstorming**

You have truly entered the *Ideation* phase of the design process. This is the third "step" in the design cycle. 

> Remind students that the Design Thinking process is not actually linear in the real world, where designers move back and forth between all the phases. However, for teaching purposes, it's easiest to learn it in a linear progression.

The hallmark of the *Ideation* phase is brainstorming—i.e., structured mental free-thinking and creativity. A designer's goal is to spark ideas — in the form of questions and solutions — through creative and curious activities.

*Ideation vs. Brainstorming:*

To avoid confusion, keep in mind that while the terms ideation and brainstorming are often used interchangeably, each term means slightly different things:  

*Ideation:*  the word means "to imagine." In UX circles, it refers to the phase of the Design Thinking process in which designers begin to come up with creative solutions for their design problem.  

*Brainstorming:* a method for generating a high volume of fresh ideas—i.e., using tools like games, pens and paper, and short bursts of time in order to think outside the box.

Now that you have explained the importance of ideation and brainstorming as a means for generating ideas for solutions to design problems, it's time to move on to *showing* students an example of a brainstorming method. The brainstorming method you'll show students next is I Like, I Wish, What if. 

## 2. Instructor Do: I Like, I Wish, What If method - Activity Demo (10 min)

Your goal with this demo is to help students get practice with the I Like, I Wish, What If method. It's important for students to understand this method because it's used by real-world designers and is a powerful method for generating ideas for potential solutions to design problems. 

This Demo has three steps:  

**Step #1** — First you will show an example—a walk-through of the Airbnb example.

**Step #2** — Second, you will share IDEO's 7 Rules for brainstorming, to get students' minds loosened.  

**Step #3** — Third, you and your TAs will facilitate the Airbnb Brainstorm, below, to give students practice actually using the I Like, I Wish, What If method. 

###Step #1 

**Let's brainstorm for Airbnb**:

- This is a simple and extremely useful method to structure feedback.
- This format can be used by teams of two or as many as 100 people.
- _I Like_ statements convey positive feedback.
  - Example: I like that Airbnb shows me reviews based off of communication
- _I Wish_ statements convey negative feedback.
  - Example: I wish that Airbnb could show you a virtual tour.
- _What If_ statements talk about the distant future.
  - Example: What if Airbnb had a chat client so I could easily talk to hosts?
- Feedback is best given with "I" statements. This method creates positive communication because it reframes statements from something negative to something positive.
  - Example: “I sometimes feel you don’t listen to me” instead of “You don’t listen to a word I say.”
  - Also, saying "I wish" is more positive than saying "I don't like."

###Step #2

**IDEO 7 Rules of Brainstorming**:

So how do we brainstorm? Well, IDEO - a famous design company - pioneered some basic rules.

>  Tip! Invite individual students to reach one of the seven rules from the slide aloud to the class. 

1. Start with a problem statement
   - Identify the core subject or the main aim of the exercise.
2. Encourage wild ideas & defer judgement!
   - There are NO bad ideas at this point. Even if an idea doesn’t seem realistic, it may spark another idea.
3. Build on the ideas of others: 
   - Think “and” rather than “but”.
4. Stay focused on a topic: 
   - Brainstorming is focused work, so keep your users’ problems in sight.
5. One conversation at a time: 
   - All ideas need to be heard so they can be built upon each other.
6. Be visual: 
   - Draw your ideas, as opposed to just writing them down, complete with stick figures, simple sketching and words to help convey your ideas.
7. Go for quantity! 
   - Good ideas to have lots and lots of ideas to choose from.

###Step #3 

This is the part where you and your TAs will facilitate a student discussion of the Airbnb slide: 

1. Have a TA go to the whiteboard.
2. Call on 5 students: They should come up with three new I Like ideas. 
   - Have the TA write the ideas on the board.
3. Call on 5 students:  They should come up with three I Wish ideas. 
   - Have the TA write them on the board.
4. Call on 5 students to get 3 new What If ideas. 
   - Have the TA write them on the board.

*Ask the TAs to vote on their favorite ideas.* 

>  Before moving on, pause to ask if there are any student questions or an observation TAs would like to share. 

Now that you have given students time to discuss the I Like, I Wish, What If method, it's time for them to dive in deeper by doing a hands-on student activity. This will be even more relevant to them as soon-to-be designers because they will use the problem statement they created last class for the activity. 

## 3. Student Do: I Like, I Wish, What If Activity (45 min)

> Note:  For additional guidance, please see the instructor-racing activity solution file, here: [02-Week/05-Instructor Resources/Activities/02.2-01-I-Like-I-Wish-What-if-Ideation_Instructor_Solution](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1j9PtkdWU8rLnUWkpcxBrTbzLkwTN32Vi)

TAs—Slack out the following Activity Instructions file to students:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owjh-RWRTjIw4P1qd0D97sxHnn4KQEuDeiZAk_RZj1A/edit?usp=sharing

**Summary**

This activity is aimed at giving students hands-on practice with brainstorming, which is core to the Ideation phase of the Design Thinking process. It's now that the connection between the user problem and brainstorming should really "click" for students, as they use their own problem statement from last class in this brainstorming activity.  

**Instructions**

Students should refer to their problem statements, user personas, empathy maps, affinity diagrams, and user insights to write as many I Like, I Wish, What If ideas as they possibly can on Post-it notes.  Following that, they will cluster their ideas into categories, title them, and then dot vote on individually and then with a partner. 

**Deliverable**

Students should generate a dozen or more individual I Like, I Wish, What If statements from their brainstorm, categorize them, and apply a dot vote process to it. 

> Take a moment here for students to capture their ideas, as well as to congratulate students on the large amount of ideas they have generated. 

### 4. Instructor Do: Ideation Review (5 min)

Get students' attention and let them know time is up. 

Together with your TAs, do a review so that students can better absorb the substance of the activity they just completed. 

Consider asking some of the following questions:

- Who came up with 5 ideas?

- Who came up with 10 ideas?

- Who came up with more than 20 ideas? 

- How would you choose the idea you want to build first?

- How would you choose the second idea you want to build?

- How do you think designers choose ideas?

Students just generated a lot of ideas. They might be wondering, with so many ideas how do designers narrow it down to one "winning" idea? 

That is a good question. And there's a process for it. 

:gem: Design Anecdote:  Share an anecdote from your professional design life that supports this point about the process of generating many ideas and narrowing them down.

In the next section, you will move students through the process of narrowing down lots of good ideas into a few relevant ideas—which is called feature prioritization.  

## 5. Instructor Do: Feature Prioritization (15 min)

> :pushpin: The goal for this section is to help students grasp the concept of organizing ideas according to their level of priority and importance using a feature prioritization matrix.   

It's exciting to come up with ideas, and brainstorming can be a thrilling process. Yet it can also be exciting to narrow those ideas down into a small group of *really good* ideas. In order to do that, designers use a process of prioritization, which students will now learn how to use.  

In this section you will show the process design teams use to prioritize features. This helps them identify which ideas/features they are going to more forward with, and which ideas they are going to disregard. It's called feature prioritization.

Before you begin, engage the class—ask:  *Who has heard of "feature prioritization"?*

Instruct the class to:

- Show you a fist if they have no idea.
- Show you a high five if they know.
- Show you a peace sign if they are feeling cool.

**Feature Prioritization** - The Feature Prioritization Matrix

Feature prioritization is how designers decide what features or experiences stay and what gets cut or postponed. It's the process of deciding what should be built when, based on what will bring most value to the user and what is feasible. 

Almost always, the priority is based on what will bring the most value to the user, as well as what is financially feasible. Features are expensive (hence tech salaries).

Feature prioritization involves critical thinking. 

It is the organizing ideas/features along an axis ranging from high to low impact and high to low priority levels—the four quadrants are these:  

*-high priority / high impact*

*-low priority / high impact*

*-high priority / low impact*

*-high priority / low impact*

**Feature Prioritization** - Three Criteria

*Three Main Criteria for Prioritizing Features*

1. **Feasibility** is a technical consideration and will need the inputs of the technical team members.

2. **Desirability** is the customer-experience focused part of the analysis.

3. **Viability** of the work needs to be considered as a function of the overall business.

Two additional key terms to know when understanding Feature Prioritization:

Product/Market Fit:

- **Product/market fit** is the degree to which a product satisfies a strong market demand (aka makes money).
- This is always the goal of a company.

Scope Creep:

- **Scope creep** is what happens when you ignore feature prioritization and product market fit.
- This is the death of projects.

**How to Prioritize Features**

- Create a 2-by-2 matrix with Priorities and Impact as your x and y axes.

- Write your favorite 8-10 ideas on sticky notes.

- Arrange sticky notes by priority and impact, factoring in your user persona.

> Pause long enough for a few questions to arise. 
>
> It's really important that students have a solid grasp of the feature prioritization matrix before they jump into creating their own. 

Now that students have a sense of the feature prioritization matrix, it's time for them to apply their learning and craft own of their own. The following activity give students practice using the critical thinking skills of a designer. 

## 6. Student Do: Feature Prioritization Matrix Activity (15 min)

> Note: For additional guidance, please see the instructor-facing activity solution file, here: 

[02-Week/05-Instructor Resources/Activities/02.2-02-Feature-Prioritization_Instructor_Solution](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1j9PtkdWU8rLnUWkpcxBrTbzLkwTN32Vi)

TAs—Slack out the following Activity instructions file to students:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xXPszh1813nvO9_MLrDCBT1v28zCP8vYw2J6kx-LsS4

**Summary**

This activity is aimed at giving students hands-on practice thinking critically about how to prioritize the many ideas that come from a brainstorming session. This is an important skill because it moves designers through the ideation process rather than trapping them under a mountain of ideas. 

**Instructions**

Students should draw a matrix with four quadrants, label each quadrant, and then place their Post-it notes from the previous What If activity in the quadrants.  If they get stuck, students should feel comfortable consulting with the TAs, yourself, or their classmates to complete the activity. 

**Deliverable**

Students should generate a well-labeled feature prioritization matrix that contains organized Post-it notes with ideas from their I like, I Wish, What If activity. It's important that students are able to rationalize why they placed each idea in a particular quadrant.  

> The feature prioritization matrix is a tough concept for many students. Be sure to walk the room with the TAs and help out the stuck ones.  

## 7. Instructor Do: Feature Matrix Review (10 min)

Call students' attention back to the front of the room. With your TAs, review the activity with the class.

Consider asking some of the following questions:

- Who identified one main idea/feature?

- Who identified two main ideas/features?

- Who identified more than two?

- Now that you have an idea, what might you do next as a designer?

>  TAs—check in with students who are still struggling with the concept to help clarify the feature matrix, before they begin the next activity. 

In the last section, students generated a large volume of ideas using I Like, I Wish, What If. 

In this section, students organized and prioritized them in order to narrow things down using the feature prioritization matrix.

In the next section, students are going to take their feature prioritization another step further: they'll learn how to tell a story about the key ideas/features they identified in order to connect the ideas/features to the success of the business they're designing for. 

## 8. Break (10 min)

Encourage students to get up from their desks. Everyone should get some fresh air, stretch, or have a few bites of food. 

Have a nice break!

## 9. Instructor Do: The Business Value of UX & Competitive Analysis (15 min) 

> :pushpin: Your goal here is two fold: help students appreciate how product features drive the business side of UX and walk them through how to perform an analysis of competitive products on the market.  

In this section, students are going to shift their perspective a bit and look at the ideas/features that they've prioritized, and look at them from a business perspective. This is important because as UX designers, they will need to know how to tell a story about how key ideas/features connect to the success of the business they're designing for. 

There is one thing that all successful businesses have in common. Ask students if they can name what that is: 

> ***Question:  What do all successful business have in common?*** 
>
> ***Answer: They cater to their users.***

Delivering a top-notch user experience is about more than effective product design — it’s good business.

**UX Drives Significant ROI for Business**

- Often cited by UX evangelists, Tom Gilb’s research in the late 80s found that every dollar a company invests in UX can yield a return of up to $100.

- If you build something that’s nice to use, more people will want to use it — and keep using it.

- When it comes to UX, the focus is often on the usability of a website or an app for users. However, UX design is not only about improving the usability, but also to *encourage user behavior that will drive business success*.

- As part of our research process, we have to be able to look out at the industry and determine whom might we be competing against.

Competitive analysis is part of the research designers do throughout the Design Thinking process. Typically, competitive analysis is done alongside the empathy, definitions, and ideation phases to ensure that the problems designers are defining, ideating, and prototyping aren't already on the market or are poorly done by the competition.

**How do businesses evaluate their competition?**

Competitive Analysis:

- Is a standard practice in business to identify competitors in the marketplace.

- In terms of UX, it is used to evaluate:

  - What features competitors have.

  - Strengths and weaknesses.

  - The usability and overall user experience.

**Reasons to Conduct Competitive Analysis:**

- To find **inspiration** in other people’s success.

- To find **opportunity** in other people’s design faults.

**Two Main Types of Competition:**

- *Direct competition:* Businesses are competing for the same potential market. Example: Uber vs. Lyft.

- *Indirect competition:* Conflict between vendors whose products or services are not the same but that could satisfy the same consumer need. Example: Uber vs. Driving your own car (car manufacturers)

**There are two Popular Methods for Conducting Competitive Analysis:**

1. *Plus/Delta Model:* This is the simplest way — a pro/con list. Pluses are features that are working, deltas are opportunities for improvement. 

2. *Feature Inventory:* Tracks a list of features available across all your competitors, as a way to compare features, identify gaps in the competition or yourself and help you prioritize features.

**How to perform a Competitor Analysis**

Let’s say we work on a UX team that is designing a care insurance quote app. Since we're at the point in our Design Thinking process in which we have narrowed down and prioritized our ideas and features, it's the perfect moment to see what "the other guys" are doing. It's time to evaluate the competition.

- First, identify your competitors.
  - Identify both *direct* and *indirect* competitors.

- Second, we would identify our competitors and take screenshots as we analyze their product.
  - We would evaluate and annotate things they do well or do poorly. 
  - Take notes about what they do well or could do better using the Plus/Delta Model or the Feature Inventory method.

- Finally,  we turn our notes into a detailed deliverable—i.e., a competitive grid.

In the next activity, students will get to create their own competitor analysis, which will give them experience with thinking about the business side of UX design.  

## 10. Student Do: Competitor Analysis (15 min)

> Note: For additional guidance, please see the instructor-facing activity solution file, here: 

[02-Week/05-Instructor Resources/Activities/02.2-03-Competitor-Analysis_Instructor_Solution](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1j9PtkdWU8rLnUWkpcxBrTbzLkwTN32Vi)

TAs—Slack students the following file and read through the instructions with them:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F8pMOAP_pCiqPjF9lTpoT1t-Jx8Low69rQivTc-FKds

Once students hit Step 3 of this activity, students will need the Competitor Analysis Template. Slack them the following: 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14UTBhaTMsr5erMcgSvGeClK-pC79Sb57MW6_GSYoFOw/edit#gid=1229686124

**Summary**

This activity walks students through an analysis of Airbnb's competitors using a critical eye, spotting strengths and weaknesses, and then compiling their data into a table.  

**Instructions**

Students will get into groups, then search for competitors of Airbnb online. They should identify four competitors total (two direct competitors and two indirect competitors), which they will critique for strengths and weaknesses. They will then fill in the competitive analysis grid (document) with their analysis.

Note: each group will complete one competitive analysis grid. 

**Deliverable**

Students will create a competitive analysis grid that shows their analysis of four of Airbnb's competitors, two should be direct competitors and two should be indirect competitors. It's important that students think critically about each competitor and find *both* strengths *and* weaknesses in their product design.

> Be sure to walk the room with the TAs and help out anyone who is stuck or has questions.  

## 11. Instructor Do: Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

It's time to hold a critique of the competitive analysis grids.

Start by selecting a file from Slack and opening it. Ask the relevant group to walk you through the competitor analysis.

- Provide your feedback:

  - *What is one thing you like about this?*
  - *What is one thing you would do differently?*
  - *What surprised you about this process?*
  - *How might this process influence your feature prioritization?*


If time allows, open two to four additional competitor analysis grids, and repeat the feedback steps.

## 12. Instructor Do: Business Model Canvas & Value Proposition Statements (10 min)

> :pushpin: Your goal is to help students understand what a value proposition is, prepare them to write one, as well as how a value proposition is an intersections of UX design and business.   

:gem: Design Anecdote: Share a personal experience in which you worked to communicate brand value to users, so that studnets can hear about your own thinking process as a designer. 

In this section, you're going to stay in a business mindset by introducing students to the concept of a value proposition. You'll present the value proposition statement in a business context by showing them a business model canvas. The canvas is useful for illustrating to students the extent of all the business concerns that are in play, and how the value proposition statement sits within that. This helps students to see where the work they'll do as designers intersects with the business. 

**Business Model Canvas**

Part of business research means learning about how businesses create value. To do that, we're going to talk about the Business Model Canvas and value proposition statements. 

*The Business Model Canvas* is a strategic management and lean startup template for developing new or documenting existing business models. It is used to describe, design, challenge and pivot a business model. By using it, you can better understand of a model so designers or product managers can develop better value propositions.

The Business Model Canvas splits up the main components of a business model, which is the model used to run a business. This shows students the context within which the value proposition sits. The value proposition is part of a larger business canvas. 

For our purposes, we only want to focus on the value proposition aspect of the business model canvas. 

**Why Value Propositions?**

A value proposition is a one-sentence description of what benefits a product or service provides, for whom, and how. They are reasons a user chooses one product over another. 

Value propositions and the value they describe matter because:

- If you are unable to communicate a product's value to customers, why should customers place value in what you offer?

- If you are unable to tell customers why they should choose you and why they should pay you what you are asking, why would they?

**How to Create A Value Proposition.**

Answer 4 questions:

1. What do you do?

2. Who is it for?

3. How will your product change their life?

4. What makes you unique?

A few examples of Value Propositions:

- Facebook – “Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.”

- Netflix – “Watch TV programs and films anytime, anywhere.”

- PayPal – “The simpler, safer way to get paid.”

- Reddit – “The front page of the internet.”

Before moving on to the student activity, help students more deeply grasp how value propositions are important to UX design work— well as to businesses designers work for. 

Ask—"Who can tell me why value propositions represent an intersection between designers and businesses?"

Invite several students to offer their thoughts.  

This will help them appreciate the intersection between business and design, an appreciation that will benefit their design careers and communication with stakeholders.

> Pause for questions before moving on to the activity, which is the final activity of the evening.

## 13. Student Do: Value Proposition Statement (25 min)

> Note: For additional guidance, please see the instructor-facing activity solution file, here: 

[02-Week/05-Instructor Resources/Activities/02.2-04-Value-Proposition-Statement_Instructor_Solution](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1j9PtkdWU8rLnUWkpcxBrTbzLkwTN32Vi)

TAs—Slack students the following link and read through the instructions with students:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lGxR_SPvx4sFNTfdkzceb9DHkuCDTgqojO3RuFNsX5U

**Summary**

With this activity, students will write their first value proposition statement. This will help students understand more about the relationship between user problems and product features is—i.e., that product features must address the user problem *and there's a process for figuring it out*.   

**Instructions**

In groups of four, students will create a value proposition statement for Airbnb.com. Each group will submit one statement.

**Deliverable**

In groups, students will write a value proposition statement that clearly addresses a user need. Their value proposition statement will say who the user is, how the product changes their life, and what makes it unique. 

> Be sure to walk the room with the TAs and help out anyone who is stuck or has questions.  

## 14. Instructor Do: Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention and prepare to review and critique their value propositions.

> Depending on the number of groups students gathered into, you should be able to review every group's value proposition. If not, invite the left over groups to stay for office hours and receive feedback. 

Choose a file from slack and open it.

- Ask a random student who is not in that group:

  - *What is one thing you like about this?*

  - *What is one thing you would do differently?*

- Ask a TA:

  - *What is one thing you like about this?*

  - *What is one thing you would do differently?*

- Provide your own feedback:

  - What is one thing you like about this?

  - What is one thing you would do differently?


Repeat this process for each groups' value proposition.

> End by taking questions regarding the value proposition concept. 

Guess what? That's it! 

### 15. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)

This is the end of class. 

Remind students that office hours will be held for the next 30 minutes. If anyone needs help on homework, now is the time. 

Wish everyone a good night.
