## 2.2 UX/Design Thinking + Ideation

### Overview

Last class, you completed your walk through the *Definition* phase of the design process and its tools, and moved into the *Ideation* phase. Today's class continues along with the *Ideation* phase and the tools designers use as part of their ideation process. 

This lesson has four learning arcs:

1. First you'll walk students through using the I Like, I Wish, What If method of ideation and brainstorming.
2. Second, you'll show them how to create a feature prioritization matrix.
3. Third, you will explain how competitor analysis works as it relates to UX.
4. Fourth, you'll  walk students through creating value propositions.

Additionally, so that students begin to get a bit of exposure to the business side of user experience, you'll be showing them a business model canvas as well.

### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

- Put ideation and brainstorming into practice with the "What if, I Like, I Wish" method.

- Use a feature prioritization matrix to practice prioritizing features.

- Create a competitor analysis.

- Define a value proposition statement. 

### Instructor Notes

- **Today's Slides**

  Here are your slides for today's lesson: 

  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tf41FNiEFwADDUU8v4fPd2S-2GqcuW8wP9oHnk0_cyk/edit

- **Review the Slides Beforehand**

  Review the slides before class, and make any teaching notes you'll need. As you lecture, relate your own on-the-job experience whenever possible to bring what students are learning to life and connect it to their future goals.

- **Student Activities Build Upon Each Other**

  Make sure your students know that the work they complete today in class will be needed for the activities scheduled for the next lecture. The knowledge and skills covered today will be built on in future classes.

- **Working in Groups** 

  Encourage your class to work in pairs or groups in order to not only help them move through activities in class and learn from their peers, but also to prepare them for teamwork as a designer.

- **Read Activity Instructions Out Loud** 

  Students will be able to more readily dive into their Activities if you provide verbal guidance. There's no need to read the instructions word for word, but do summarize the key steps. 

- **Keep track of the Clock.**

  - Have TAs consult the Time Tracker: [02-Week/03-Time Trackers/02.2 Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dgOaEIy2jsjsTXGGJ_YTABmAdS8AkGvFLN_DDIu2maQ/edit#gid=71637037)

- **Empower TAs to participate**

  TAs can help you stay on track and can add texture to your lesson. Encorage their participation and input.

- **Watch a class**

**Ideation & Brainstorming**

You have truly entered the *Ideation* phase of the design process. This is the third "step" in the design cycle. 

The hallmark of the *Ideation* phase is brainstorming—i.e., structured mental free-thinking and creativity. A designer's goal is to spark ideas — in the form of questions and solutions — through creative and curious activities.

*Ideation vs. Brainstorming:*

To avoid confusion, keep in mind that while the terms ideation and brainstorming are often used interchangeably, each term means slightly different things:  

*Ideation:*  the word means "to imagine." In UX circles, it refers to the phase of the Design Thinking process in which designers begin to come up with creative solutions for their design problem.  

*Brainstorming:* a method for generating a high volume of fresh ideas—i.e., using tools like games, pens and paper, and short bursts of time in order to think outside the box.

- This is a simple and extremely useful method to structure feedback.
- This format can be used by teams of two or as many as 100 people.
- _I Like_ statements convey positive feedback.
  - Example: I like that Airbnb shows me reviews based off of communication
- _I Wish_ statements convey negative feedback.
  - Example: I wish that Airbnb could show you a virtual tour.
- _What If_ statements talk about the distant future.
  - Example: What if Airbnb had a chat client so I could easily talk to hosts?
- Feedback is best given with "I" statements. This method creates positive communication because it reframes statements from something negative to something positive.
  - Example: “I sometimes feel you don’t listen to me” instead of “You don’t listen to a word I say.”
  - Also, saying "I wish" is more positive than saying "I don't like."

**IDEO 7 Rules of Brainstorming**:

So how do we brainstorm? Well, IDEO - a famous design company - pioneered some basic rules.

1. Start with a problem statement
   - Identify the core subject or the main aim of the exercise.
2. Encourage wild ideas & defer judgement!
   - There are NO bad ideas at this point. Even if an idea doesn’t seem realistic, it may spark another idea.
3. Build on the ideas of others: 
   - Think “and” rather than “but”.
4. Stay focused on a topic: 
   - Brainstorming is focused work, so keep your users’ problems in sight.
5. One conversation at a time: 
   - All ideas need to be heard so they can be built upon each other.
6. Be visual: 
   - Draw your ideas, as opposed to just writing them down, complete with stick figures, simple sketching and words to help convey your ideas.
7. Go for quantity! 
   - Good ideas to have lots and lots of ideas to choose from.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owjh-RWRTjIw4P1qd0D97sxHnn4KQEuDeiZAk_RZj1A/edit?usp=sharing

**Summary**

This activity is aimed at giving students hands-on practice with brainstorming, which is core to the Ideation phase of the Design Thinking process. It's now that the connection between the user problem and brainstorming should really "click" for students, as they use their own problem statement from last class in this brainstorming activity.  

**Instructions**

Students should refer to their problem statements, user personas, empathy maps, affinity diagrams, and user insights to write as many I Like, I Wish, What If ideas as they possibly can on Post-it notes.  Following that, they will cluster their ideas into categories, title them, and then dot vote on individually and then with a partner. 

**Deliverable**

Students should generate a dozen or more individual I Like, I Wish, What If statements from their brainstorm, categorize them, and apply a dot vote process to it. 

> Take a moment here for students to capture their ideas, as well as to congratulate students on the large amount of ideas they have generated.

**Feature Prioritization** - The Feature Prioritization Matrix

Feature prioritization is how designers decide what features or experiences stay and what gets cut or postponed. It's the process of deciding what should be built when, based on what will bring most value to the user and what is feasible. 

Almost always, the priority is based on what will bring the most value to the user, as well as what is financially feasible. Features are expensive (hence tech salaries).

Feature prioritization involves critical thinking. 

It is the organizing ideas/features along an axis ranging from high to low impact and high to low priority levels—the four quadrants are these:  

*-high priority / high impact*

*-low priority / high impact*

*-high priority / low impact*

*-high priority / low impact*

**Feature Prioritization** - Three Criteria

*Three Main Criteria for Prioritizing Features*

1. **Feasibility** is a technical consideration and will need the inputs of the technical team members.

2. **Desirability** is the customer-experience focused part of the analysis.

3. **Viability** of the work needs to be considered as a function of the overall business.

Two additional key terms to know when understanding Feature Prioritization:

Product/Market Fit:

- **Product/market fit** is the degree to which a product satisfies a strong market demand (aka makes money).
- This is always the goal of a company.

Scope Creep:

- **Scope creep** is what happens when you ignore feature prioritization and product market fit.
- This is the death of projects.

**How to Prioritize Features**

- Create a 2-by-2 matrix with Priorities and Impact as your x and y axes.

- Write your favorite 8-10 ideas on sticky notes.

- Arrange sticky notes by priority and impact, factoring in your user persona.

TAs—Slack out the following Activity instructions file to students:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xXPszh1813nvO9_MLrDCBT1v28zCP8vYw2J6kx-LsS4

**Summary**

This activity is aimed at giving students hands-on practice thinking critically about how to prioritize the many ideas that come from a brainstorming session. This is an important skill because it moves designers through the ideation process rather than trapping them under a mountain of ideas. 

**Instructions**

Students should draw a matrix with four quadrants, label each quadrant, and then place their Post-it notes from the previous What If activity in the quadrants.  If they get stuck, students should feel comfortable consulting with the TAs, yourself, or their classmates to complete the activity. 

**Deliverable**

Students should generate a well-labeled feature prioritization matrix that contains organized Post-it notes with ideas from their I like, I Wish, What If activity. It's important that students are able to rationalize why they placed each idea in a particular quadrant.  

> The feature prioritization matrix is a tough concept for many students. Be sure to walk the room with the TAs and help out the stuck ones.

## 7. Instructor Do: Feature Matrix Review (10 min)

Call students' attention back to the front of the room. With your TAs, review the activity with the class.

Consider asking some of the following questions:

- Who identified one main idea/feature?

- Who identified two main ideas/features?

- Who identified more than two?

- Now that you have an idea, what might you do next as a designer?

>  TAs—check in with students who are still struggling with the concept to help clarify the feature matrix, before they begin the next activity. 

In the last section, students generated a large volume of ideas using I Like, I Wish, What If. 

In this section, students organized and prioritized them in order to narrow things down using the feature prioritization matrix.

In the next section, students are going to take their feature prioritization another step further: they'll learn how to tell a story about the key ideas/features they identified in order to connect the ideas/features to the success of the business they're designing for.

**Why Value Propositions?**

A value proposition is a one-sentence description of what benefits a product or service provides, for whom, and how. They are reasons a user chooses one product over another. 

Value propositions and the value they describe matter because:

- If you are unable to communicate a product's value to customers, why should customers place value in what you offer?

- If you are unable to tell customers why they should choose you and why they should pay you what you are asking, why would they?

**How to Create A Value Proposition.**

Answer 4 questions:

1. What do you do?

2. Who is it for?

3. How will your product change their life?

4. What makes you unique?

A few examples of Value Propositions:

- Facebook – “Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.”

- Netflix – “Watch TV programs and films anytime, anywhere.”

- PayPal – “The simpler, safer way to get paid.”

- Reddit – “The front page of the internet.”


Guess what? That's it! 

### 15. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)
